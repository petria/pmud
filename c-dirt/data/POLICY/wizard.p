        As a wizard you have the freedom to do what you want to do.

        You deal with players the way you think is right, we don't have
        any explicit rules here, as opposed to other muds. We trust you
        with the privilieges you are given.

        A few quick notes...        

	&+Wo&NHelping players with quests is permitted here. It is unadvisable
	  for the wizard to divulge vital aspects of the quests, however.

	&+Wo&NAn *occasional* teleport from a tight spot can save a player a
	  great deal of frustration, but use them with infrequently and
	  with discretion.

        &+Wo&NHealing is perfectly acceptable here.  Please heal players at
          your own discretion.  Just try to keep it challenging for the
          runners.  (ie. constant healing, while allowed, is frowned on).

	&+Wo&NWizards are not advised to hand out weapons & armor without
          reason.  For example, giving a newbie a basic shield and sword is 
          quite Ok, while handing out cloned mjolnirs is not acceptable.  In
          the event of a crash, wizzes may give out CLONED weapons to players 
          who ask for them.
