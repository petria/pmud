A heavy iron bound book has been left here.^
^
^
^
The book details many arcane and powerful magics, mostly to cause
 severe pain to other beings.  In a flowing hand is written:

Fireball
        A potent piece of magic much dependant upon the power of the caster
        as to the damage it does, although sulphur enhances this.
Missile
        A similar magic, much popular amongst mages.  It is said that magical
        talismans may be created to aid this spell.
Shock
        A spell of touch, which can pass through metal armors with great ease.
        A decent caster never uses this as a party trick.
        Lodestones help with its casting.
Frost
        A spell similar to a fireball in power. A direct hit will slow
        your opponent down and make his aim less sure.  It is said that
        wintergreen will enhance this spell.

Any mage should beware that casting magic, though potent, will drain the
strength of the caster.

This is a hefty and gruesome weapon, much favoured by orcs, who often use them
for cutting cakes, trimming toe nails, and ripping out the insides of hobbits!

Great Worm of Newurk to single combat. And his description of the
destruction of the Temple of Balzuv in the conflagration known as
the "Great Balsuv Fire". Most of it seems pretty silly, but the

        One day, Cedric and Ged found themselves standing at the
        entrance to the Catacombs.
        Said Ced, "How are we ever to traverse this maze of catacombs?"
        Said Ged, "I do not know, for the interconnections of its
                   chambers are most intricate.  Perhaps we should ask
                   Tedd, the Zen Master of Aber."
        So they did.
        Said Ged, "Oh wise and most learned Tedd, how can one find one's
                   way through the treacherous maze of the catacombs?"
        Said Tedd, "One can't.  Send Ned."
        And suddenly Cedric and Ged were most pleased, for Tedd had
        shown them the path to enlightenment.

This appears to be a poorly written diary of a trapper that practices his 
trade in the swamplands.   Most of the entries recount mundane catches and 
places that the trapper has been to, but one entry catches your attention:

The journal seems to belong to Dinthiar, the elven king.  It speaks of what
has happened to this once beautiful land.  It seems that there were two
great evils, who had been engaged in an eternal war with each other.  They
had shifted from world to world, leaving each one a desolate ruin behind
them.  Sadly, one day the two evils came down upon this beautiful realm.
Here, their last battle was fought.  One of the two, a demon of great power,
still resides in the caves to the west, lording over the land he helped
destroy.  The other, a deathless lich, was forced to flee.  It is rumored
though, that he still hides somewhere in these lands.  Dinthiar believes
that the elven lands can still be restored.  What is needed is a great hero
to vanquish the two ancient evils...

In other words, you realize, the dark elves are as much to blame for the
destruction that you have seen, as anyone!

MY CURIOUS EVOLUTIONARY ADVENTURE by Heidi Stromberg (draft copy)
    This is a brief account of the incredible adventure that befell me as I
was assisting Professor Schumann with his archaeological dig on the east coast.
During a break in digging I decided to indulge my favourite pastime of scuba
diving.  I found a quaint old jetty to the south of where we were digging, and
slid into the water.  I immediately found myself in an extraordinary setting.
Around me were hundreds of creatures the like of which I had never seen before,
except in simulations of the Cambrian sea bed.  I realised I had stepped back
in time over five hundred million years!  Naturally I did not waste the
opportunity and set about collecting some evidence of my extraordinary journey.
    As I continued to swim over the sea bed, I noticed the flora and fauna
changing, and new genera began to appear.  It became apparent that I was
advancing through time!  I had a little dig in the mud and unearthed a perfect
early fish skeleton, and I kept it, resolving to show it to the professor if
and when I returned to the present day.  After a while I found myself in what
must have been the Devonian period, for I was beset by early sharks and
placoderms and God knows what else.  It was scary, and I had to swim like crazy
in order to escape.  Somehow I found my way to land, and wandered for a while
through a dark forest of carboniferous trees.  Knowing early reptiles often
fell into rotting stumps I searched for hours for such a thing, but eventually
I fell foul of a couple of large amphibians and had to make my escape.
    Later, as I made my careful way through the Mesozoic (keeping a close eye
out for dinosaurs, of which there were an alarming number!) I searched in every
place I could think of.  I left no stone unturned.  At length I ended up in a
cave and there met the professor, and I realised that I had come full circle.
It was bizarre.  I gave him my eight skeletons and he was very excited, but
keen for more, so I returned to the jetty for a second bout.
    And this is where I am now.  I'm about to re-enter the water to seek out
more intriguing discoveries.  I collected an ammonite shell from the Ordovician
and I will store these notes inside until I am on dry land again.  My only fear
is that I will meet one of those ferocious arthrodires again.  If I do, I think
I might just abandon the quest and dump the aqualung.  If the professor is so
keen on more exhibits, let HIM be the one to face the danger!  Anyway, time to
go.

diary <null> 46 957 957 -1 0 2 669 0 0 0 0:0 0 0 40 3 0
A tattered diary has been dropped here.^
^
^
^
The diary is old and many of its pages are missing.  As you read it, an
incredible tale unfolds.  The writer of the diary was part of an expedition
which set out three months ago to find El Dorado, a mythical city which
supposedly lies in the great rainforest to the south-east.  The expedition
crossed this great mountain range, then descended into the rainforest and set
out on their ambitious quest.  After some time they had a major disagreement
and the group split up, one half continuing to battle through the forest while
the other built a raft and floated down the river.  The writer of the diary was
in the party which took the slow route through the jungle.  During weeks of
fruitless searching the party gradually dwindled, one by one falling victim to
one or other of the jungle's manifold hazards.  When there were only a handful
left, they abandoned their quest and attempted to return home.  The final
entries in the diary are increasingly surreal, and it is plain that the writer
was steadily losing his grip on reality.

Greetings Traveller!
Pray hear our cry of distress, and aid us in this our darkest hour!  Know that
for the past three months, ever since the ants invaded the volcano known as
Bandilbar, our lives have been a misery.  Our town is raided nightly by hordes
of hideous worker ants, and our people have been carried off to work as slaves
inside the dread mountain.  Some have been turned into undead fiends that
return to haunt us.  Our population is dwindling and we have nobody to turn to.
Please return this notice to the mayor if you will help us!

The cover reads 'The History of the Bhelliom'.  It appears that the
troll Ghwerig once combined all the powers of the Troll Gods into the
magical stone, the Bhelliom.  In order to get or use the Bhelliom, one must
be in possession of the two keys to activate it.  These keys were made in
the form of two ruby rings.  Where those rings are today is a mystery.
However, the Bhelliom was stolen by a human, and then lost in one of the great
battles during one of the many wars between the Elenes and the Zemochs.  It is
believed Ghwerig recovered the Bhellim  at some point, but it is unknown.
There are references to the gods of the Styrics, in particular, the Goddess
