   This musty chamber is cluttered with old bones and scraps of clothing.
Your footsteps stir up the thick dust choking you with its dry bitter taste.
No treasures remain, having long ago been looted by barrow robbers.

Plain^
Gloomy Plain^
   You are standing at one end of a vast underground plain. A murky orange glow
dimly illuminates this place. A narrow path has been worn into the gray dust of
the plain, which wends its way westward between scattered clumps of withered
plant life.

River^
Banks of River Styx^
   You stand on the bank of a river that cuts through the plain. The river is
foul and murky. Behind you to the east a path crosses the barren plain and
above you to the north is a mound of rocks. To the west a boat sits on the
river, waiting patiently.

Rocks^
In the Rocks^
   This mound of rocks could have been the ancient remains of a watchtower
that afforded a good view of the river. The far bank looks even more desolate
and forbidding than the near one, it is probably a good thing that the river
seperates them. Up river, to the north, the current is much swifter as it
gushes through a rocky narrow canyon. To the south the river wends it way
slowly out of sight.

Charon's Boat^
   You stand on Charon's boat at the edge of the River Styx. The boat is
actually little more than a raft propelled by polling it along the slow
current. From here you could return to the eastern bank, though you get
the feeling that few passengers do. Charon is not here now, but there is
a collection box with a coin slot in it.

of grayish brown and yellow. Even though the water moves slowly here, movement
upstream would be impossible without supernatural help.

The Abyss^
   You are at the face of an enormous curved basalt cliff that extends down
out of sight into a dark pit. A small sign, hand painted in blood, tells you: 

     Mortals keep out!

A black door set into the face of the cliff has a dark arrow above it pointing
down. A sign pasted on the door informs you the elevator is out of order.
For those hearty souls, a large, circular stairway has been carved into the,
cliff face, allowing you to make the long descent into the black pit.

the priests of this ancient city used to worship their god of Earth and the

there are carvings on the stone. The walls block your way to any other 
direction, but west.

The tunnel is widening as you move further to the south and seems to end
in a small chamber just a few yards before you. The walls are glistening
in the dim light coming from your torch. It looks like the rock around you
would consist of various valuable minerals. Despite this splendid sight 
you feel quite uncomfortable and start feeling dizzy for some reason.

The Edge of Downtown^
As you walk further the walls turn smooth and the floor is covered with

a long series of small pictures that seem to tell tales about this town's 
history. The story begins with a flourishing dynasty and an emperor who 
ruled the surrounding plains. To find out more you have to walk further 
to a large underground hall to the north. You notice that you still can 
turn back to the south.

abandoned, the astronomers found a new bright star in the sky. The star
was thought to be a sign of destruction coming to the town. You can see 
more of these pictures leading to each direction.

brings light into this otherwise dim chamber. By studying the pictures on 
the floor, you find out that most of the slaves and servants were killed
when the upper class moved down underground. The ghosts of these poor people
still wander these lands of blood. To prevent the ghosts from entering
the underground town many guardians have been placed at the entrance.
The only exit is to the east.

You feel strong magical powers surrounding you as you enter this room. 
The story tells that there was a disc of the mighty Sun God originally 
placed on top of the huge sun pyramid by the sun god himself. After the 
messages about the destruction were received, the priests had a holy 
stone and a feather of the sacred Quetzalbird, brought from a hermit 
living at the Tropic of Cancer to move this holy item.

The natives might like snakes and even worship them, but the snake living

your mortality and makes you consider whether to leave at once or try to
slay that rattling thing before you. You suddenly notice that the floor
is covered with gold items and your natural greed makes you consider the
the matter even harder. The snake, however, is guarding these valuables so
you can't just take them and leave. It might already be too late to escape
back up.

a long time ago. The owner of the books, however, seems not to have this
problem for the books look as if they have been read through thousands of
times during the preceding centuries.

stone fireplace which is surrounded by ceiling-high bookshelves.  As you
glance at the bookshelves, you notice that the books range from topics in
philosophy and mathematics to the latest works of fiction...there are even
a few books here that you have never heard of before.  On the floor in front
of the fireplace is a thick, plush black rug.  All in all, this seems the
perfect place to spend the evening whether you would like to have some time
for yourself or invite a close friend or two over.

Blizzard Pass^
   You are trudging through deep snow as you follow a narrow track that winds
down the pass leading southward, its end hidden by a succession of rocky spurs
that jut out from either side.  On both sides of you the mountains tower high
above the pass, their peaks veiled in clouds.  At one point, however, the cliff
is nowhere near as steep and a fair way up a single window has been cut,
looking out across the snows.

is scarred by a deep crevasse.  The snows extend in all other directions save
north, where a lighted inn offers warmth, food, and shelter from the elements.

descending down a fissure in the cliff itself.

stare in awe as you gaze upon a whole host of plantlife taken from every period
of Earth's history.  To the left are tree ferns, towering thirty feet high,
spreading their feathery fronds for many yards in all directions.  To the right
are horsetails as big as trees with great woody trunks that bear no resemblance
to the little grass-like weeds that are so common around wet ground in the
countryside.  And in front of you, towering towards the roof, are several huge
lycopods, like trees in size and shape but related to mosses and their kin.
A number of less massive exhibits are lined up against the glass walls of the
greenhouse, and some shrubs and monkey puzzle saplings grow here and there
in the shade of the lycopods.

rocks here slippery to the touch, but you can discern footholds safe enough 
to climb up the face of the cliff, and a slightly (but not by much) safer 
path, only a crack in the rock, leading down near the rocks below.

down into the murky swamplands below.

impervious to the thick plant growth.  Looking around, you see that most of 
the ground here consists of hard rocks and pebbles that have fallen down 
from a nearby gully up the cliff, making it hard for plants to root in.  A 
path hugs the cliff, but still uncomfortably close to the swamps to the 
east, which for some strange reason makes your skin crawl.  A break in the 
twisted trees lie to the south, and it looks as if you could scrabble 
through the pebbles up the side of the escarpment.

plant growth, you feel some dreadfully evil influence has been the cause of 
this.  In the face of the cliff here is recessed a cave, where within, you 
can only discern blackness, though you spy some boot prints leading in and 
out of the cave, evidence that someone resides here.  A smell emanates from 
the cave, reminding you of some old stale bread and musty animal skins.  To 
the east and west, the path continues to thread its way along the base of 
the cliff.  Looking again into the swamp, as if your eyes are drawn there, 
you spy a glimmer of gold in the dark murk, but before you can blink to 
clear your vision, the bright spot is gone.  The path leads off at a 
descending slope to the east and west, and a smaller trail leads south, 
toward a small grassy glade.

you tread this lonely beach.  The water at this end of the coast is ringed 
in by a perimeter of sharp rocks, supposedly brought in some time in the 
past to break the tortuous waves beyond, and it in effect creates a calm 
lagoon.  You see a tall cliff loom up from the north, the beach leading up 
to a sharp west-north bend.  A bleak-looking stream lets out a little ways 
to the south, just north of a line of more tide-breaking stones.

The cool, refreshing waters seem to beckon to you, to join in the knee-

of containing the vibrant life of plants and water life, bears the smelly 
slimes, fetid algae, and uncleanliness of whatever dwells from within the 
dark swamp, causing your nose to wrinkle.  The stream looks no more than 
waist-deep, but any travel to the south bank appears futile, with a 
formidable wall of thorny bramble bushes to meet you there.  More hopeful 
paths lie to the east, where the stream thins out into the sea, and to the 
north across a grassy field.  To the west, you see another, less traveled 
path following the stream toward the edge of the swamp itself.  Such 
feelings leave you to think that travelling into the swamp would not be a 
good idea.

it from the stream.  Few if any plants seem to conglomerate at the stream's 
edge, and how sickly and twisted the ones are that live there.  You can 
follow the shoreline to the north, to a more welcoming beach, or follow the

Outlining the swamp is a long beach, running up to the cliff foot directly 
under you, and then splitting off, one trail continuing north up the beach, 
and the other disappearing out of view to the west.  A range of mountains 
line the valley far to the west and southwest, and nestled in front of the 
range directly to the west is an old and eroding castle, with one black 
tower still defiantly standing.  A path leading north is the only way out 
of this narrow cliff corner.

Hills of Grass^
        Walking on the cushiony grasses, you find yourself on one of the many 
hills that roll off into the distance.  Travelling here could become easily 
disorienting because of rolling effect the hills create.  You feel relieved 
to see marked trails leading off to the north and south.

Rolling Meadow^
        Grassy hills roll off into the distance here as you walk by, and you 
smell the fragrances of the wild grasses and flowers growing all around. 
The hills flatten out to a large field to the west, where you hear the 
bleating of sheep.  Another path to the south makes a easterly turn along a 
cliff edge.

        The loamy smell and plaintive sound of bleating sheep is the first

the north and the west, the ground appears to drop off beyond a fence to 
the south, and to the east, a modest but welcoming cottage making this 
place look like the idyllic scene of pastoral harmony.

Inside the Shepherd's Home^
        This is the sparse and simple home of the shepherd, a little too 
simplistic for an adventurer of your tastes, but obviously adequate to the 
shepherd.  A table with two chairs rests against the eastern wall, a window 
over the table showing more rolling hills outside.  A simple straw bed lies 
to the south, a stone hearth to the north, and an exit back outside lies to 
the west.

        South of the rolling hills, you overlook from a cliff edge the 
lowlands of the swamps looming some two hundred feet below you to the 
south.  Lucky for you, a sturdy looking fence is between you and the ground 
far below the cliff.  Even with the fence, doing anything gymnastic would 
be foolhardy.  You can follow the cliff edge to the east, or follow a 
westward path wending its way to some hills.

The hills are tall here, giving you little view of the land around you.  
The only promising routes lie between two hills to the north, where the 
path starts to cut into a large and rocky third hill, and to the south up 
an even larger hill.

        You walk to the north end of the shoal, the salty water mere inches 
deep here.  The shoal breaks the waves up here, making them less fierce 
against the beach that lies some eighty feet to the west.  You see various 
fish and marine life being washed along by the waves, and some larger 
aquatic denizens making waves of their own.  The water appears too 
treacherous and deep in all directions save to the south.

that the waves are broken somewhat by the shoal, since you are only swaying 
in your steps at each wave instead of floundering head over heels.  The 
water is noticeably colder here, giving hint that any travelling farther 
east would not only be dangerous due to the waves and sea creatures, but 
also to the exposure of the cold water.  You can follow the shoal to the 
north and south, or back to toward the west, since the water looks much 
shallower here.

in all directions but north, the water is too deep to safely traverse 
without aid, and even then, the waters to the west look impossibly 
traversable.  You feel something slimy and smooth brush your leg, and it 
makes you start thinking that staying longer might not be the best of

and carefully laid over with sticks and covered in stones, save for the 
hole that you fell through.  You try to leap for a handhold at the top, but 
hopelessly cannot find anything in reach,  showing you that this pit was 
built to hold much larger creatures.  Small rodents and other land-dwelling 
animals are here, but all starved to death.  Obviously the last time that 
the trapper checked this trap was quite some time.  You just hope that he 
remembers it today...

lies in ruins about you.  Blackened stumps abound and the trees which still
stand reek of decay.  This secluded vale has obviously been destroyed by some
great disaster.  You are overcome by a sense of foreboding! The evil which
ruined this forest may still be around!
   Although deeply disturbed by the destruction around you, you manage to look
about to determine your position.  To the North and East are the mountains
which shield this valley.  The area to the South of you also heads into
mountains, but a path makes passage possible.  An archway marks a tunnel
through the eastern mountains.

the heavens, and simply pushed the trees down, in a line from West to East.
The few Oaks which still stand have been warped into unhealthy shapes, which
nature itself could never produce.  Following the line of downed trees, you
realize that it leads to a freshly hewn pathway in the mountains to the West.

to the east of you.  To the west, the line of destruction seems to continue.
Mercifully, mountains to the east protected any further realms from this

the arched, wooden roof, are numerous tiny flowers, hanging from the vines
which grow around you. Even in the dim light, the brilliant hues of the
flowers - red, violet, blue, green, and white - stand out. Indeed, they glow
with their own light, providing the majority of the illumination in this room
and sending incredible, multi-colored shadows around the room. As you stare at
them, something tugs at your memory. You have seen that pattern somewhere
before... It is the pattern of the stars in the night sky, but of a color and
brightness that the night sky can only hint at.
   As your eyes slowly refocus on the mundane plane, you notice a wooden
throne set near the middle of this room.  With a start, you realize that is
has been grown from the tree itself.  Once, the whole elven forest must have
been like this...

Throne Room^
   You have entered the throne room of Asmodeus, the Demon Lord who, in his
battle with the evil lich, destroyed the beautiful elven forest.  If that foul
creature is still around, he must be destroyed!  You rapidly glance around the
room and see, in the middle of the room, a throne made out of human bones.
You gag at the sight, and rapidly look for exits from this room.  They lie
to the South and West.

this room is not as grotesque as the study that you just passed through.

Surely they will miss you at dinner tonight . . .
With a thump, you land in a heap of sticks and dry leaves. You jump
to your feet and look around to find yourself in a long passage,
stretching to the north. Squinting, you can barely make out a
bobbing, white shape down the passage to the east.

fences around them, and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs
and chickens, all made of china, standing around in groups. But the

golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most

the rainbow tribe! The cavern is damp and cold, and the sights are as
chilling as the air. Skeletons lie randomly around the room, as
though thrown around by some giant hand. Scraps of fabrics and
jewelry are visible mixed with the bones.

Well^
  A series of rungs have been set into the wall of this well to allow
access to the bottom.  They are cold and slimy, and you pray that no
rain falls to raise the level of the brackish water below. On the east
wall, far below you, is a door which you suspect you could reach
if you jumped from the rungs.

  You have entered a large, lavishly-decorated room. This must be
the end of your quest, for among the gold brocade and silver
furniture is a coffin. A throne rests against the north wall, inlaid
with expensive gems. A crown rests on the throne, also inlaid with
shining stones. A closet filled with valuable robes and gowns is
against the east wall. The coffin is made of an alloy which you do
not recognize, which seems to reflect the light. The coffin has been
carved with Sleeping Beauty's name and face.

the area further inland, but you can see a gap in them where the stream's 
erosion has broken through.  The beach stretches on to your north and south, 
and the choppy sea stretches to the western horizon.

        The cliffs that divide this beach from the main expanse of the island

Steps have been cut into the face to the east, however, and should make ascent
easy.  Down the beach, to the west, stands the sea, and a ship rests in harbor
to the northwest.  The beach continues to the north.

Freshwater Outlet^

        The beach is broken here by the outpouring waters of a freshwater 
stream, forcing its way down to the ocean.  Standing on the rocks at its edge,
you can see a gap in the cliff wall, undoubtedly cut by the stream in its 
youth.  This leads to an eastern valley between the cliffs, while the beach 
reaches underneath this facade to the north and south.  To the west, the 
outlet has formed a small harbor, where a ship bobs in the choppy waves.

will rejoin the sea.  To the east, human figures move back and forth from a 
wide, shallow bank of the stream, to a forested area further to the southeast.

The peasants glance at you, but hurry away without asking questions, either 
too busy or too afraid to find out who you are.  The stream flows from a slope
to the north, curves here and continues down to a broad valley to the west, 
and presumably from there out to the sea.

toward the rice paddy.  One of the storehouses is open and unguarded to the

large enough for two humans to stand under.  The floor is strewn with small 
stones, but swept in places as if someone's feet had been placed there and 
moved in small circles.  The ledge continues up and to the east, meeting up 
with a path from the beach to the cliffs.  The only other way off this ledge 
is to descend to the beach, to the south.

toward the temple.

Darkening Skies^

        The sky overhead seems to actively darken as you pass this way, going 
from a dim storminess to the north, to a sickly slate to the south, where dark
branches reach hopelessly toward the swirling clouds.  The road seems 
increasingly out of repair as you look in that direction, also.

Dusty Road^

        The north-south road leads off to the horizon in either direction,

Dust blows across the road, back toward greener lands... a glimmering of pink 
shows to the north, the only visible sign of life.

End of the Road^

        The road ends abruptly here... since there is no land for it to cross.
You stand on the edge of a abyssal gap, the sod and rock torn away from the 
edge as if scraped out by a titan's foot.  Rocks dislodged from the edge 
tumble for nearly half a minute before hitting the bottom, and you would 
undoubtedly suffer the same freefall and landing if you were to continue on.

eastern portal is open to the "air."  A rickety ladder also leads upward onto

straw dummies dressed in clothing and armor were used to begin weapons 
training. Of course, there was no substitute for human instruction, and 
several marked areas on the floor undoubtedly served as sparring rings.

A large courtyard flanked by statues and landscaping.  Koi float belly-up in
small pools, and once-beautiful stone gardens have been raked across by claws
rather than garden tools.  A stench of sulfur hangs in the air, which seems to
darken as you near the center of the city, the daimyo's fortress to the north.
To the west, a guardhouse has been erected along the wall.   To the east, the 
remains of the city's homes lie in long-dead ashes.
        The city walls are in the opposite direction- south- and the barred 
gate looks impassable from this side.  The high earthen walls are too smooth 
to climb without aid.

city walls, sections of the land are also burned away, in strips that match 
the path of a landing meteorite.  Bubbling pools of various colors have 
erupted from the ground where these streaks end, and seem to spread across 
the land as you watch.  The cherry orchard to the south smokes where Kashai 
fell.  The only safe way out of here is down...

        Nothing except a smell of sulfur seems out of place in the quarters of 
the daimyo's daughter.  Odd, considering that the princess' body lies broken 
on the flagstones below the window...

Daimyo's Quarters^

        Blood stains the sheets of the Daimyo's bed, and his quarters show the
signs of an attack.  The wardrobe is over on its side, and its sides show 
evenly spaced slashes, like claw marks.  Chairs and other small furniture lie 
smashed in one corner, and every one of the ruler's personal effects has been 
broken- his sword, his helmet, his seals, everything.

Daimyo's Throne Room^

        The Throne Room's opulent surroundings are befouled by demon stench 
and brimstone haze, and the throne itself is smeared with grime and blood.  
Silk tapestries that once hung proudly on the walls have been apparently used
as  handkerchiefs and... toiletries.  The daimyo and his court are piled on 
either side of the throne like so much cordwood, and your ire rises at such 
mocking destruction.

The Heavens^

        The vast, otherworldly aspect of this room takes some time to 
assimilate:  The domed ceiling looks up into the sky, but the view is 
unencumbered by clouds, haze, or indeed, air.  Bare suns and glowing nebulae
illuminate the space in which you stand.  Dragons wheel about these heavens 
occasionally, glancing down on you in amusement.  And before you... before you
is the Orb of Yin and Yang, capable of throwing the balance of creation to 
good or evil exclusively.  The Demon could not harness its full power, so 
undoubtedly you cannot either, but even at its weakest the Orb could make you
a formidable ruler... but it must be returned to its place.  The steel arch 
that transported you in waits to the north, and a strange circular portal 
hovers to the south, visible but not solid.

and they are streched over a small, but very fastflowing river out of sight
to the southwest.  A very fastflowing river emerges out of the damwall a 
couple of yards west of you and disappears out of sight into southern parts of
the cavern.  There is no way of following the river southwards or crossing it.
Sparks jump now and then from lots of tiny cords which hang down from the 
three powerlines, thus enlightning the place in a strange blue and green light.
This place is surely in lack of maintainance, so you would better get
out of here.  It can be done by climbing a flight of stairs which is
cut out in the side of the wall.

a huge and arched oakdoor set between mighty pillars carved out of
rock in one piece.  The door is barred with strong ironbars and it
will take you a lot of work to get through it.
It is possible to go east and west from the main entrance.

boulder^
Blocked passage^
This tunnel east of the bank is stopped abruptly by a boulder which
fills the tunnel with rock from grinded stone-dust size up to the
size of rocks whick will never be moved by humans alone.
Even a mouse won't be able to crawl through this boulder.
Thus, the only exit for you is to the west.

Side Entrance^
This is the west side of the bank of Frobozz and it seems much more
promising than the main entrance.  That is due to a door of normal
size and construction which is situated right in front of you in a
corner of the building.  The bank is certainly in lack of windows, but
you have already figured out that the bank trusts the Great Under-
ground Empire's inhabitants because this side entrance will certainly
not be impossible to break down even for you.

The Bank of Frobozz^
You are in the main hall of the bank of Frobozz.  The roof is held up
by mighty stonepillars like those you saw outside the main door
which leads into this room.  The ceiling is made of dark wood, and
combined with the light colours which the walls are decorated with and
the fine gold inlay in the massive pillars the whole room resembles
something like a temple raised for a highheld god.
Right to the north is the tellers' room and that's where you may
withdraw sparemoney or let the bank take care of them.
In the south wall of this stunning room there is the main entrance to
the bank.  The door is barred with strong ironbars which makes the
bank look very safe.

Luncheon Room^

abandoned just af if something terrible has happened.  They did not
even have time to clear the place from the waste and rubbish from their
meals.  The mess surely indicates that they didn't wait guests to pop in.
There is a door in the south wall and an entrance into the more important
parts of the bank.

The Tellers Room^
You have entered the tellers' room.  This is where the transactions of
money once in the past happened.  There are about a dozen of tidy and
rather impressing desks here which were used by the tellers when
doing business with their clients.  The desks are now covered with
dust.  To the south, through a high and arched opening you can look
into an impressive hall.  It is probably the main hall of the bank of
Frobozz.  Through a similar, but smaller opening to the north you see
a large and representable office.  There is also a doorway to the east
and to the west a doorway leads back into the luncheonroom.

You are in what must be the entrance to the vault of the bank because written

to find the vaultdoor.  Is it simply a walk-through-wall or is the vaultdoor
fitted so nicely into the wall that you can't find it ?
The room is lit by some kind of light which comes through a thickglassed 
window measuring 1 foot in square set into the northern wall.
The tellers' room lies to the west.

It is clear from the size both the room and its contents that this must

contains nothing of excess, but the stuff that has been placed here
is of extraordinary quality and must surely have costed many a tellers
wages.  Right in front of you completly dominating the room is a large
mahogny desk which is one of the bigger you have seen.  Right behind it
placed up to the wall is a cupboard which in quality and splendor must
have been made by Chippendale himself.  More descretely in one corner
an inviting sitting-group almost begs you to take a seat.
To the south an opening leads into the tellers' room.

This chamber is nearly pitch dark, but a few sunbeams manage to get
through a crystal grating in the ceiling.  The grating is just
reachable but the size of it prevents you from climbing through it when opened.
Worth noticing are the extremely dark walls of this chamber.  It is as
if they are made of lightabsorbing material.
There is an exit to the south and another exit into a pitch dark

Entrance to the Elven Forest^
   A magnificent expanse of forest spreads before you. The morning mist has not
quite lifted totally from the ground, making the Elven Forest a mystical place
to gaze upon. You feel awed. The ancient forest lies in grand splendor, as yet  
untouched by the two evils warring in your present time. Instead of corruptness,
you are moved by the beauty the forest and wish that the trees would be this
lush in your own time. You have no desire to leave this beautiful land. To the 
north you see an high overview of the forest, to the south you see the entrance
of a dwelling of some sort, hidden well behind thick bushes.

you wonder what sort of person the Green Mother really is. Couches and chairs
are made out of the natural things, grown out of either wood, moss, or some
such living material.
   A miniature sun warms the place, keeping it light. The walls allow fresh air
through to circulate, and little trickles of water flow from the ceiling keeping
everything alive. The floor is springy with plantlife, and you slightly bounce
along as you walk. Two rooms are formed off of this one.

is now owned by his daughter, fair Skadi-- who was Njord's bride.

Valhalla^
   Looking up, you notice that the roof is made of shields, and the rafters
are spears.  Breast-plates litter the benches.  A wolf lurks at the western
door, and an eagle hovers over it.  A deep and wild looking river, Thund,
roars beside Valgrind, the outer gate.  Five hundred and forty doors lead
off in different directions, but you suspect that eight hundred warriors
stand behind each one, so you opt not to open any of them.

walls are a disgusting dull white and you are starting to get sick of 
this color.

Fogey^
Old Fogeys' Room^
   This room is for Old Fogeys to sit in and lament all the mistakes of their
lives.  Forlornly scattered about this depressing room are old dentures, broken
eyeglasses, and rotting toupees.  Next to a boarded-up window is what was
obviously once an elegant indoor flower garden, its contents long wilted and
desiccated.  An old wind-up phonograph is producing a very scratchy sounding
rendition of sad songs from decades past.  In the center of the room are
several uncomfortable-looking chairs made of rotting wood, arranged in a
circle.

Clearing^
Sacred Clearing^
   You find yourself in a clearing deep in the Misty Mountains.  Some mighty
being has carved this niche out of the living rock, making a place suitable for
the gods themselves to wed.  A simple podium in the center of this clearing
lends to the overall impression that this is a holy place.
   Stands have been hewn out of the mountain and intricately carved with an
animal motif.  Each of the 50 seats depicts a different creature, and all
appear calm and serene.
   A feeling of peace and goodwill washes over you as you gaze in awe at the
majestic peaks that surround this place.

The Higher Plane^
   You are standing on an infinite plane, perfectly flat as far as the eye
can see in all directions.  The sky is a strange glowing pattern of lines
that seem to twist and writhe.  The flat surface under your feet seems to be
covered with some sort of fractal pattern.
   As you stare at the patterns, you begin to sense a higher order of reality,
feeling that if you stared long enough, you would understand the nature of
the universe...

Stargazer^
Stargazer's Quarters^
     You are in a clearing under a green, airy  canopy  somewhere
in  a  luxuriant  forest.  Gigantic trees of majestic proportions
surround you in all directions.  However, as far as your eyes can
see, there is nowhere dark under the trees.  Even where the trees
are largest the sunshine penetrates, subdued by  the  foliage  to
exquisite  greenish-golden  tints,  fills  the wide lower spaces.
Above you, golden shafts of light filtered through some break  in
the  foliage,  give a strange glory to everything they touch.  At
the center of the clearing is a great green  mound  covered  with
sward  of fragrant grass.  The mound is dotted with small golden,
white, and pale-green flowers shaped like stars, glimmering  like
a  mist amid the rich hue of the grass.  On the top of the mound,
upon a low pedstal stands a basin of silver,  wide  and  shallow,
filled with crystal clear water.  In the distance, like a tempest
of wind mixed with the shrilling music of  some  unknown  musical
instrument,  the  songs  of birds fill the air.  This place gives
you a strange sense of vibrant energy and contentment.

You stand in awe in a vast cave dominated by a crystal pool. The surface
of the water is a perfect mirror, casting silvery reflections on the walls.
Magic fills the air, and in the water there are manatees and manatoos.
Dewdrops glisten on the rocks and edelweiss grows in the most unlikely
places: among stones and unfinished ice sculptures. The bed on the north
wall shimmers a magical blue. The other walls are filled with the
colors of some unseen rainbow. Surprisingly, the room is quite warm, upon
closer inspection, you notice a heating duct in one corner. Ah, the wonders
of central heating.

The sound of the soft romantic music coming from the stereo
puts your mind to ease and you sigh happily as you look around
the room some more. There is a large fireplace that takes up most
of the southern wall that casts out shadows around the room and
as you come closer to the fire the heat soothes your nerves and
you smile. In front of the fireplace there is a soft bearskin rug
that looks quite inviting to curl up on and stare at the fire, or
to curl up with someone else and spend time together. Against the
north wall there is a luxurious bed that looks very inviting to
relax on. There is a dark blue comforter spread over the bed with
soft blue pillows on top of it next to the headboard. 
  The master bathroom is to the east and the garden balcony is to

   You have entered the bedroom of Bargalad and Pandora. Just looking around
this room it is easy to tell that they are newlyweds. The large, comfortable
waterbed is covered with a plaid comforter in bright yellows, blues, and reds.
The bed covers are folded down to reveal white satin sheets. A lovely yellow
rose has been placed across the pillows. Above the bed there is a beautiful oil
painting of a couple on their wedding day. (Bargalad and Pandora maybe?) You
can't help but stare at the handsome couple. A very large television is pushed
against the wall facing the bed, and a copy of 'The Medicine Man' is still
playing. A large victorian mirror dominates a wooden chest of drawers, and
pictures of the couple and their family and friends cover the top. Next to you
is an open door which seems to lead into another room. A huge window allows in
enough light to illuminate the room. The window, which is framed in bright
yellow curtains that are pinned up with matching bows, overlooks a breathtaking
view of the lands below. As you walk around the room and your feet sink into
the plush wall to wall carpeting, you can't help but think how lucky Bargalad
and Pandora must be.

   As you walk in, the first thing you notice is the opposite wall.  It
is lined, floor to ceiling with guitars.  You notice various vintage
models: the double-necked Gibson that Jimmy Page played "Stairway to
Heaven" on live, the double-necked Rickenbacker bass/guitar that Geddy
Lee used with RUSH, the Fender Stratocaster that David Gilmour recorded
"Dark Side of the Moon" on, the Stratocaster that Eric Clapton played on
"Layla," and the Ibanez played by Steve Vai.  In the corner, you notice a
little upright piano -- an inscription tells you that Tori Amos learned
to play on this very instrument.  Looking to the wall on your right,
you see an impressive stereo system with an equally impressive CD
collection: autographed copies of "The Wall", "Slowhand", "Houses of the
Holy", "Moving Pictures", "Under the Pink", and "Sailing the Seas of
Cheese" (you stop and think to yourself: "Sailing the Seas of Cheese"?!)
On the wall above the CD player, there is a limited edition 10,000 Maniacs/
REM poster in a black frame, autographed by various members of the bands.
You also notice a note on the Under the Pink CD which says "Stay awake next
time!"  In the center of the room is a large whirlpool.  Oddly enough, it
appears to be in the shape of a large cucumber, and the lights under the
water give it a strange purple glow.  Too bad you didn't bring your speedos.
The room is well furnished in all black, with black marble floors and what
looks like obsidian trim.  You are tempted to have a seat on the plush
black sofa, pop in a CD, and listen to your favorite tunes.

Hell^

pretty well and you are now getting the punishment that you deserve.

the foot of the volcano which created this bleak landscape.

New Players' Welcome Centre^
    Welcome to Crossroads MUD!  For those of you unfamiliar with this kind of
adventure game, the object is to acquire points and complete quests, eventually
reaching the level of wizard, at which point you become immortal and gain all
kinds of special powers.  A tour for new players begins to the south of here.
If you do not wish to take the tour, go down to the temple.  If you would like
to learn how to play the game, go south by typing 's' for south.

Communication (1)^
    There are many ways to communicate with the people on this mud.  If you
wish to talk to somebody directly without anyone else hearing, use the 'tell'
command.  For example if you wish to say hello to a player called Dave, type:
tell Dave hello
Usually the word 'tell' is not necessary - you could also type:
Dave hello
If you are in the same room as other people and you wish to say something which
they can all hear, use the 'say' command.  For example, type:
say Hi guys!  What's new?
To continue with the tour, type 'e' for east.  Alternatively you can return to
the welcome centre by typing 'n' for north.

Communication (2)^
    If you wish everyone on the mud to hear what you say, you can use the
command 'shout'.  However if used a lot this will irritate many people, so
please keep your shouting to a minimum.
    A better way to talk to everyone is the 'chat' command.  Chatting a lot
will not offend people, because everyone has the ability to switch off the chat
line.  To do this type 'nochat'.  To switch the chat line back on again, simply
type 'nochat' again.
    To continue with the tour, type 'e' for east.  To return to the first
communication room, type 'w' for west.

Rooms^
    This is now the fourth room that you have visited.  There are thousands of
rooms on the mud, all linked together so that you can get from here to any
other part of the mud.  The rooms are not arranged in a haphazard manner but
are grouped together into zones, each zone very often having a specific theme.
Some zones contain quests which you will have to solve eventually, but for a
beginner it is best to get a feel for the mud first before attempting these.
    If you type 'exits' you will see which rooms lie adjacent to yours, and
quite often this will provide you with important information.  If the exit to
the south is called 'Crumbling Cliff-Edge', you would be wise to think twice
before going south!  Often the description of the room you are in will tell you
something about your exits, so it is always a good idea to read the description
of any room you have not been in before.
    To continue with the tour, go south.  To retrace your steps, go west.

Objects^
    You will find many items as you progress through the mud.  Some will be
useful to you; others will not.  You can only carry a certain number of items,
but you will soon get a feel for what you need and what you do not.  Pick up
items using the command 'get' or 'take'.  Drop them again using the command
'drop'.  To see what you are carrying at any time, type 'i' or 'inv' (short for
inventory).  You can practise these commands on the towel in this room.
    When you are ready to leave the game, you can get points for the things you
are carrying.  Simply return to the Temple Of Paradise or the Village Church
and type 'drop all'.  Your stuff will disappear into the pit and you will gain
points.
    To continue the tour, go west.

Mobiles And Combat^
    Mobiles, or non-playing characters, are your adversaries in this game.
Some are there to help you, but most are ripe for the killing.  Beware though -
some may be tougher or better-armed than you, so it is advisable to find out
how strong a mobile is before attacking it.  To do this, use the 'examine'
command, or 'ex' for short, followed by the name of the mobile.  This will tell
you how tough it is.  To attack a mobile called 'elf' type 'kill elf'.
    It is important to keep track of your own status, especially when fighting.
Type 'score' to see how you are doing.  If your strength ever falls below zero
you will die and lose half your points.  Your 'wimpy' value will help to
prevent this by making you flee from a battle automatically if your strength
falls below that value.
    To continue the tour go south.  To get some equipment, go west.

Weapons And Armor^
    Your fighting abilities will be greatly enhanced by wielding a weapon and
wearing armor.  Armor can take many forms, and the more pieces you are wearing,
the better you will be protected.  You can only wield one weapon at a time, but
some weapons are better than others.  The equipment provided here is fairly
good, but it is for new players only - use it to try to find where to find good
equipment elsewhere on the mud.  Make sure that when you get a weapon, you
wield it, and when you get some armor, wear it!  If you type 'wearall' you will
automatically wear anything you are carrying that is wearable.

The Fountain^
    To help you start, there is a fountain from which you can drink to gain
2000 points.  Type 'levels'.  This will show you how many points you need for
each level.  Drinking the fountain will take you to level 3.  To drink, simply
type 'drink fountain'.  You must drink about fifty times to reach level 3.  But
relax!  You don't need to type 'drink fountain' fifty times.  The command '!'
will repeat whatever your last command was.  So type 'drink fountain' once,
then '!' fifty times or so until you get a message telling you that you are now
a hero/heroine.
    To get to the fountain, go east.  If you want to go to the Temple of
Paradise, go down.  If you wish to go to the Village Church, go south.

dimmer, as the sun dips behind the western rim of the valley.  To the south is
the rocky soil of the base of the mountains.  The peaks of the Teeth rise up
to the east, their majestic beauty stealing your breath for a moment.

Canyon^
   It's not the Grand Canyon, but it'll do.  The light here is very dim, as the
sun is well beyond the rim of the canyon.  It is much cooler here too, but the
air is fresh and clean.  There are some wildflowers and brush growing here and
there.  The northern end appears to be blocked, but there is a path to the    
south.  There are some birds chirping in the distance.

Foothills^
   The mountains rise up sharply before you.  The air is much colder here, and
a cold breeze blows down from the pass above you.  Below you are the lowlands
of this mountainous area, and grasses and scrub brush can be seen struggling
to grow there.  The path is littered with chunks of granite from the eons of 
creation that have passed.

In The Teeth^
   The peaks of the mountains surround you, their sharp outlines cutting into 
the horizon.  A cold wind bites into your exposed flesh, chilling you.  The
path is now covered in snow, and glare from the sun causes you to squint a
bit.  The powdery snow crunches under the tread of your boots as you proceed
along the trail.

Mountain Peak^
   You are amongst the peaks of the mountains.  It is very cold here, and a
strong wind stirs up the snow around you, making it difficult to see.  The snow
is much deeper here, and small amounts of it slip into your boots from time to
time, making them cold.  It seems very quiet and desolate up here, and no one
has apparently been along in quite some time.  But with the shifting, drifting
snow, it is difficult to tell.

Gorge^
   There is a faint smell of ozone in the air.  You are in a deep gorge below
the mountain peaks, where you find some relief from the constant wind.  There
are some markings in the rocks, and some of them appear to have melted at some
point in the near past.  Apparently lightning storms are a common occurance
here.  There is a path that goes off into the peaks above you, which you    
could climb with only moderate difficulty.

craggs rise up to the south, their snow covered peaks reflecting the orange
glow of the setting sun.  Above you there is a clearing, which would appear to
offer a beautiful vantage point to look out over the lands below.  A trail
winds its way down to the northern areas.

far north.

is off to one side, where you could rest and enjoy the view.  The vista from
here is an awe-inspiring one.  You command a view of a valley, through which
you see a small stream cutting its way.  Beyond the stream, you see a very
small temple on a hill. To the north, you see a large, fortress-like structure
rising from the cliff-tops.  The valley is adorned with trees, many of which
still retain some autumn colors.  Way off in the eastern horizon your keen eye
spies a tower on a ledge, and some buildings to the south of it.  There are 
some moors off to the far north-east.

There are fields of wildflowers stretching off to the north and south, their  
vibrant colors waving about in the cool autumn breeze.

happily.  To your west, a wooden bridge spans the river, and to the east a path

   The land here is, well, decaying.  The trees are mere skeletons, and the
grass is brown and dry.  Nothing seems to be living here, and you notice the

musty and old, like the inside of a vacuum.

river can be seen flowing by the eastern side of the building.  A bird's nest
can be seen in one of the rafters, but it too appears to have been abandoned.

hold the band members anymore.  The wood has long since lost any appeal and is
now a dull grey color.  Off to the east is a rotting old house, which looks
like it is tired of standing there.  On the doorpost you see the rusted remains
of the address, "2B".

occupied with the task of being mud instead.  It pulls at your boots slightly

Cobbled Courtyard^
   Your boots click upon the cobblestones as you enter the castle's main 
courtyard.  One of the castle's walls runs along the perimeter to the north,
while a fountain burbles happily to the south.  A path runs east, through 
the inner gates, to lands beyond.

Fountain^
   A small, circular fountain is here, spraying water up into the air.  Sun-

the spray, scattering it and causing a rainbow to appear.
   To the north you spy a courtyard, and to the west a small doorway opens
into the castle proper.

Tapestry Room^
   This small room used to house the castle's many fine tapestries.  A few 
mouldy ones remain, hanging limply and unattractively from the walls.  Some
straw covers the floor, apparently an attempt to make the room more comfort-
able.  There are several iron hooks in the wall that used to hold torches, but
have been emptied long ago.

wall.  Along the side of the castle entrance are some marigolds and other 
flowers, providing a sweet fragrance to the air about you.

Castle Hohenzollern^
   As you enter this room, you can't help but notice the large coat of arms
placed in one corner of the room.  A few statues and a suit of armor are placed
around the room as a form of decoration.  The ceiling is adorned with a paint-
ing of the heavens opening, and an outpouring of cherubim and seraphim adorn
the edges.  The trim of the room is a prime example of baroque architecture.
   To the north you notice a small side yard through a doorway, while the
eastern exit opens out into a courtyard.  An antechamber is through a doorway
to the south, and to the west you notice a large, empty hall.

but looks like it was once comfortably furnished.  Some cobwebs have been 
spun by spiders past, and now collect dust in the corners.  To the north you
see the main entrance to the castle, to the west is the library.  A small
hole has been made on the south wall.

Tower Base^
   You are standing in the base of a large tower.  Steps lead upward into dark-

dirty from dust.

of different liquids, some purple, some green, and many other colors.  A wooden
stool sits next to the table, apparently for the person who worked in the lab.

Parsifal's Tower^
   This is apparently the tower of the wizard Parsifal.  As you think back, you
recall hearing of the greatness of Parsifal in a Bard's tale long ago.  Once
the Hohenzollern family was well-respected, but seemed to have run into
problems with a dragon that Parsifal had tried to tame.  Nothing had been heard
from the family since, and no one ever successfully returned from their castle.
   A small bed is in one corner of the room, and a table in the other.  The 
table is covered with old books and sheets of parchment.  A chair has been
overturned in the center of the room.

A thin layer of mud on the floor coats about an inch of your boots, and makes
walking difficult as you slide about.  The tunnel slopes down sharply, and it
takes great effort to keep from sliding to the bottom.  You can make out the

this hall allow a great amount of light into the room.  Stuffed animal heads,
like lions and tigers and bears (Oh my!), are hung periodically along the wall.
The ceiling is painted with murals depicting the hunts where the various
trophies were acquired.  To the east is the main entrance of the castle, and
to the south is a trophy room.  A large table in the room to the west brings
you to the conclusion that it's a dining room.

castle proper.  A few small tapestries attempt to enliven the otherwise dismal

at all - the tree is somehow anchored in its place by an unseen force.
A heady, very pleasant odour is making it hard for you to think straight.

of water floating around up here.  Still you fall, and the raindrops fall with
you, growing heavier and heavier as they descend, until you find yourself in
the midst of a torrent which plunges like a waterfall, nearly drowning you in
the process.  You fight a rising panic, then feel yourself nudging into a soft
incline, which gradually becomes less and less steep as you drop.  You slither
down it on your back, carried along by the volume of water, but slowing down
all the while, until you find yourself able to sit up and take stock of your
surroundings.  You are in a river, being gently carried towards the bank.  You
drift past an imposing-looking pagan temple and end up in a little pool beside
the river bank.

arousing conflicting thoughts within you.  You are much too confused to puzzle
them out though.

Temple Of Nasty Smells^
    Inside the temple a greenish light filters through cracks in the roof.  A
great pendulum hangs from a gantry overhead, but it has long since stopped
swinging.  The thing that strikes you most is a powerful, nauseating smell
which seems to be coming from the north.  However, the scent of the plants
outside is still strong enough to overcome the mind-clearing effects of this
new odour.

Brink Of The Cesspit^
    At last you have discovered the source of the terrible smell.  Before you
is a pit dug into the ground, filled to the brim with raw sewage.  You reel in
disgust at the reek emanating from the thick brown sludge before you.  You
cover your nose, your eyes watering, and then notice something else - several
long, fat, worm-like creatures are swimming about in the excrement, and appear
to be feeding on it!  You feel a powerful urge to leave this place and get out
among the sweet-smelling plants outside, the scent of which you can still
faintly detect even through the sewer-stench of the cesspit.  Yet another part
of you recognises the hold the plants have over your mind, and suggests you
take a much-needed bath with the sewer worms...

of the trees thin out into little terraced fields propped by stone walls, and
groves dark with olive trees and walnuts.  In the distance is the sea where a
boat is idly sailing.

Elm Tree^

tree, to your west is a knobby walnut, and to your east is a mulberry.  In the
south are the oaks, haughty and detached.

dull one moment and glittering the next.  Quite far below the lowest branch is
a mysterious garden, and to the east, a half-hidden mansion.  One high window
is quite near your tree.

almost count the far-off ripples of the waves.  Only a very light rustle, like
a sigh, runs over the pebbles on the beach.  There are some roots hanging over
the cliff face here.  They look fairly sturdy, and you might be able to climb
down if you weren't carrying much.

pass without specialist equipment.  However, you realise that once you have
gone down, there is no way that you could manage to get back up again.

provide useful steps for you to plot a safe course.  Below you is a narrow
ledge which you should be able to reach without too much trouble, although once
there you would not be able to return to this point.  To the west a steep slope

Dry Gully^

a sheltered v-shaped valley.  Alternatively you can clamber up the eastward
slope which is less steep than those to the north and west.

huge clouds of spray at the bottom, whence it calms down and begins to crawl
eastward at a far more leisurely pace.

    At the bottom of the waterfall the noise is terrific and you cover your
ears to protect them.  You quickly become soaked with the spray from the river
and resolve to hasten out of this area forthwith.  To the south you could head
into the forest, or you could follow the river as it wends its way east.

Southern River Bank^
    In stark contrast to the fury and energy of the waterfall to the west, this
spot is very peaceful.  The river here is flat and unbroken by rocks, although
debris from the foothills can be seen floating by here and there.  The flow is
fairly swift, but calm and smooth, and you feel yourself relaxing under its
soothing influence.

closer together, but their foliage is less dense and thus more light reaches
the ground here than did in the forest across the river.  The effect of this is
that the undergrowth flourishes, producing vast and rambling forms that
obstruct you at every turn.  To the south the way back to the river is easy
enough, while to the east you think you can manage to squeeze through the

Instead, slender trees send wide branching roots downwards for many feet,
burying them deep in the mud for firm anchorage, while their manifold branches
intermingle with those of their nearest neighbours for additional support.  The
river lies to the south and west.

Soft Ground^
    You are squelching through a muddy part of the forest.  The river is close
by to the south and it is making its presence felt.  With every step your feet
sink into the mud and water covers your shoes.  This land of trees and water
is beginning to get you down.

Land Of The Butterflies^
    In this drier part of the forest many species of butterfly are swarming.
Some settle on your face and arms and lick off your sweat with their long
probosces, hungry for salt.  Some of the others are huge, almost a foot across,
but those tend to stay away from you.  Their wingbeats are distinctly audible.

Leeches Galore^
    You have come upon the kind of terrain leeches love best.  And in this
humid jungle the leeches are of staggering sizes.  However the large ones are
easy to cope with; it is the small ones that get inside your clothes that you
are most concerned about.  You continually have to stop and pluck them from
your body, and that is not always easy... their suction-cup mouths grip you
with surprising strength.

up to the canopy here, some breaking through to better harvest the light.  One
variety appears to have strange knobbly spikes sticking out of its trunk,
giving it a peculiar prickly appearance.  The undergrowth is too thick to the
west for you to progress in that direction, but on all other sides the way is
clear.

On The Riverbank^
    You are on the bank of the river Kerapi.  Here it is hundreds of yards wide
and a uniform muddy brown.  To the east you could make your way along the bank,
while to the south the trees are tall and dark, though well-spaced.

Inlet^
    The bank ends suddenly here, cut through by a long inlet that runs through
the trees to the south.  Crossing it would be almost impossible, since it is
riddled with tree roots and trunks growing up from the mud at the bottom of the
inlet.  You can turn south along the bank of the inlet or head west along the
river bank.

End Of The Inlet^
    You are at the southern end of a narrow inlet which runs north from here
towards the river.  Several species of tree grow from under the water, and some
more of the same grow in the surrounding area.  These are not tall trees but
they bear small red fruit which fall into the water at intervals while you
watch.  You can go in any direction.

Among The Fruit Trees^
    It is hard to tell where the roots end and the trunks begin, or indeed
which of the twisting lengths of wood are trunks and which are branches.  A
disordered array of woody material clambers up, down and sideways, making your
progress very difficult.  Eventually you realise you will have to concede
defeat and head back west.

Indian Village^
    You are in a small cluster of huts which for the most part look deserted.
Whether it has been abandoned permanently or whether the villagers are merely
out for some other reason you cannot even guess, but they have not been gone
for long.  The place is fairly tidy.

Dark Forest^
    You are in a part of the forest where the understorey is so thick that it
harvests nearly all of the light that filters through from the canopy.  The
result is that there are almost no ground plants and you can quite easily head
in any direction you choose.  There is a small hut to the north.

Stone God^
    You are in a deep part of the forest where only a little light reaches the
ground.  An enormous stone statue stands here, partially crumbled but still
imposing.  It appears to be a god of some kind, and its terrible eyes are
intact and manage to convey a sense of awesome power.  Whether the race who
carved it is still flourishing somewhere in the heart of the rainforest, you
have no idea.

    This small hut has been abandoned for some time.  So far from the nearest

overhanging trees, it will probably remain here untouched for a long time,
unless the forest birds use the straw roof as nesting material.

Deep Forest^
    The rainforest seems endless.  You wander on and on through trees without

cover the floor and with every step you crush scores of fruiting bodies.  A
natural dike blocks the way north.

nevertheless have been extremely rich in the precious metal.  Around you the

plated with gold leaf, and flashes of golden light from flakes on the ground
constantly catch your eye.  To the north is a massive temple, not a subtle

is a proud and kingly statue standing tall in the middle of the square.  And to
the south, most magnificent of all, a palace of ancient kings towers into the
sky.

Cold Current^
    You find yourself caught up in a strong current which is sweeping up from
the southern polar regions.  You are powerless to prevent yourself being
carried northwards at considerable speed.  To the west the trees pass by in an
endless procession, and you begin to appreciate the vast size of it.

Carried Northward^
    You inevitably come to the end of the trees and then pass by a succession
of varied shorelines, the climate gradually becoming more and more temperate.
After what seems like an age, you begin to spot familiar landmarks.  Over to
the northwest is the volcano Mount Bandilbar, presiding over a verdant
landscape.  As you slowly draw level with it you see the mountains surrounding
the blizzard pass and, closer to you, the long stretch of shoreline to the east
of the village.  Ramshackle but comfortingly familiar, the Old Seadog looms
closer and you sigh as you finally feel you have come home at last.  The cold
southern current is now so weak as to be unnoticeable, and only your momentum
carries you the last half mile to the waters just east of the jetty.

Further into the Ruins^
  You have entered into the underlevels of the ruined temple. A very 
strong musky odor that makes you gasp for air for a few seconds. Looking 
around this ancient stone-walled chamber you wonder just how old it is. 
A thick layer of green, slimy moss covers most of the walls. This chamber 
has exits leading in all directions.

End of the Southern Hall^
  This looks to be the end of the southern hall. The floor is very slippery 
from water leaking in from the upper level. A thick blanket of moss grows 
from the ceiling down the walls to the floor. You look around this room 
one more time before deciding to turn back to the north.

Mancini's Haven^
    As you enter the foyer of this house, the first thing that you notice is
the floor.  It is one giant slab of pink and white marble that stretches out
to meet the walls which are made of black and white marble.  Carved within the
walls are steps that lead up to the rotunda.  At the far end of the hall are a
beautiful set of glass French doors.  Looking through these doors, you see a
grand sight indeed.  An expansive garden filled with an endless variety of
flowers and plants stretches off to meet the massive hedge maze.  Beyond this,
you see the sparkling water of the ocean stretching off to the horizon where
you see the sun sinking beneath the waves.  Back within the room, you notice
a chandelier suspended in midair high above you.  To your amazement, it is not
made of glass, or even crystal, but sparkling diamonds!  Above this is the
rotunda which contains the upper levels of the house.  Balconies covered with
ivy line the higher floors allowing one to look down.  At the very top is a
stained glass skylight that allows a soft many hued light to filter down into
the room.  As for what is actually within this room, there is not much to see.
The most prominent feature is the pure black grand piano sitting majestically
off in the far corner.  There are but a few other items within the room,
including a few Escher paintings and the like.

and warding. Skeletons hang from the walls, some from creatures you recognize,
and others you could only guess as to their origin.  Black streaks line the
walls too, possibly from long battles with demons only a crazed evil mage
would summon onto this plane...
 A sudden sense of fear comes over you..  You have never met anyone powerful
enough to create a place such as this, and don't want to stay long enough to
meet the person who DID create this ghastly place.

below you.  It appears you can climb down to the pool if you're unencumbered.

it crosses a swiftly-moving river which hurries by as if anxious to leave the

the river, although you cannot imagine how any boat could possibly travel
upstream from here.

and pleasant-looking wood.  Just west from here is the entrance to a deep cave
cut into the volcano.

Paved Path^
    You are on the path to the west of the channel.  Paving stones descending
into the channel disappear into a wide river of lava, flowing southwards and
cutting off your western route.  They reappear on the far side of the channel,
heading towards a small and pleasant-looking wood.  Just west from here is the
entrance to a deep cave cut into the volcano.

Entrance To Bandilbar^
    You are standing beneath a low arch marking the entrance to the network of
caves inside the volcano.  The air is warm and a sharp smell of sulphur wafts
towards you from within.  To the east the cave continues, while west of here a
paved path leads down towards a deep channel running along the foot of the
mountain.

Crossroads Of Tunnels^
    You have come to a place where two tunnels meet.  The main tunnel leading
from the entrance descends in a steep decline to the west, while the tunnel
running across from north to south is somewhat smaller and the walls less
well-hewn.  Torches line the walls down every tunnel, and you have no problem
seeing where you are going.

Narrowing Tunnel^
    You are travelling along a tunnel which grows narrower as it heads east.
Ahead in that direction you can see that it bends around to the left, heading
west.  To the west is a four-way junction, and you can see cast on to the floor
there a faint patch of natural light.

Narrow Bend^
    You are at a very tight corner of the tunnel.  To the north, a little way
off, the passage ends in a rough, unfinished wall of rock.  You surmise that
whoever dug these tunnels ceased their work before this section was finished.
The only other exit is west back to the crossroads.

Cavern Of The Worker Ants^
    This is a curious place indeed.  The cavern is vast, and in crossing it you
merely skirt around the northern wall.  Elsewhere in the cavern many strange
things are happening.  Giant ants tend even larger grubs, feeding them with
piles of green leaves and being rewarded in turn by sticky secretions produced
by the grubs.  Most of the ants fortunately seem far too busy to notice you.

shaking of the volcano as it erupts threatens to cast you from your feet.

you are winded by a hard thud as you collide with a wooden post sticking out
of the water.  You cling to it like a drowned rat, and when you have recovered
somewhat you realise that it is the remnants of an old wooden pier that you
have washed up against.

have a gut feeling that wants you to go due south.

thinks you might find something up there.  It would probably be a better
idea to just stay on the path you were on.

Now, it lies empty, sealed by order of Primate Annias.  The air is cold

catches your attention, but when you look, there is nothing there.  A sadness
fills the room, and in the silence, you can just make out a heartbeat.  A chill
fills you to the bone when you realize that what you hear is the heartbeat
of Queen Ehlana, encased in crystal in the front of the room.

the Royal governing council of Elenia has been meeting while Ehlana has been
ill.  Papers, maps, and books lay strewn about in a disarray, almost as if
someone had been searching for something.  Glancing at one of documents you
are startled to discover that Primate Annias, a churchman, was responsible
for the poisoning of Ehlana.  It seems Annias wants to become Archprelate
of the Church, and poisoned Ehlana to gain access to the Elenian treasury.
Sephrenia and a handful of Pandion Knights sealed Ehlana in crystal in the
hopes of keeping her alive until a cure could be found to save her.  There is
no sign as to where any of them have gone.

A Troll's Treasure^
        This is Ghwerig's treasure room.  The cavern sparkles from the light
cast by your light source.  Jewels, gold, silks and more are piled as
far as you can see.  Ghwerig obviously has been a busy little gatherer.  A
pedestal stands before you, maybe its just the light, but there appears to
be something on it...

   A sense of peace marks this place.  A carven wooden structure which might
have at one time been an altar remains, untouched by time.  A pure white flame,
flickering at your presense floats above the side of the altar.  Beneath the
flame is a hole filled with shimmering energy.  Sunlight filters down through
tree limbs, reflected by the enegry and shattered into a myriad of tiny
rainbows.

Garden^
  When time was young and people still worshiped at the wooden altar this
garden was planned and created for the enjoyment of their goddess. Painstaking
care was taken to create a garden of surpassing beauty. The people who created
and tended the garden have long since passed from the world, but the garden
and it's peaceful beauty remain.  The garden acts as an enterway into the
holy grove, and many roads converge here.

to escape the great evil which had invaded their homeland.  The great evil
even their goddess could not defend them from.  It was the goddess who
created the land bridge, and sealed the Evil deep within their holes, under
the village.

Land Bridge^

across this narrow strip of earth centuries of years before, and their
goddess had closed it behind them.  The time has come to vanquish the evil
which waits, trapped within the great tree.

   Wildfires leap about you as a wind whips up the flames.  Everything in the
area seems to have been set on fire by a torch.  Carts, eqipment and
occasionaly a grossly deformed body can be seen burning among the ruins of the
camp.  It seems that a furious battle has just been fought here.  The only way
of escape is back to the west.

be used occaisionally. The trail winds through the deep woods to the east
and north. The canopy of the forest reaches overhead, blocking out much of
the sunlight, but the forest still has a warm feel.

other buildings between the trees. A thin wisp of smoke rises overhead.
The dirt trail continues to the east and west, and to the south there is

Town Entrance^
    The town entrance is on a slight rise, giving you a good view of the
town before you. It is dotted by several temples, and has only a few
merchants. Thick woods lead away to the west, and what appears to be the

to tell if you are still facing the way you began. The forest is full of
sharp thorns to the south, but to the north, and west it continues
uninteruptes. To the east there is a thin path covered in snow.

Snowy Trail^
    The trail is covered with snow that buried the rocks, making travel very

of the snow covered mountain that covers the south-eastern horizon. Far above
you there appears to be some sort of structure, but from here it is
impossible to tell. The trail slopes down to the east and up to the south.

    You dangle from the ledge, unable to scramble back up, for hours, shouting

    The street is slightly dusty but well maintained. The cobblestones are
neatly laid in geometric patterns. To the north is a small temple, to the
west are the main village gates and beyond them the forest. To the east is
a small garden filled with delicately carved stone statues. To the south
there is nothing but beautifully manicured gardens.

Statue Yard^
    The small garden is filled by beautifully carved statues of the elemental
gods: Naidrk the water god, Thandrain the earth god, and Klendoth the thunder
god. In between the statues are immense guardian dragon statues, their
immense size almost rivaling that of the statues. Clearly among these people
dragons are held almost at the level of the elemental gods.

Base of Tower^
   You stand at the base of a tall black tower. As you look up, a sense of
great evil overwhelms you.  A sense of deep, dark magic seems to emanate from
the top of the tower. There is a spiral staircase leading up from here, and
archways lead east and west.

Top of Staircase^
   You stand at the top of a tall spiral staircase. A trememdous red door lies
on the east wall.  A chill runs down your spine as a sense of foreboding evil
completely overpowers all of your senses.  There is an almost blindking
darkness which enshrouds the entire room.  You may retreat to the safety of
the known points of the castle below, or venture into the unknown through
doors to the east.

Center of Evil^
   You enter a small, dark room which appears to be where the ruler of this
castle practices his dark magic.  A sense of terrifying chaos resounds in this
room whose walls must have horrifying tales to tell.  There is a large throne
on the east wall, and strategic charts line the walls.  The charts seem to tell
of a plan to use a deadly beast and portholes into another dimension to conquer
the world you call home.

Base of Dragon Tower^
   You stand at the base of a tremendous tower which is even taller than the
black tower to the west.  A raw, dark energy seems to surge down upon you from
the top of the tower, and orange flashes flicker high above you.  A small
ladder ascends to the top of the tower, and an archway leads back to the west.

Dragon Tower^
   You are climbing a ladder traversing the length of a large dark tower.
Below you, the ladder leads to the bottom of the tower, which is barely
visible.  The ladder seems to lead up to the top of the tower, where bright
yellow sunlight streams in from above.

Top of Dragon Tower^
   You stand atop a tremendous tower, which has been built partially into the
side of a mountain.  The tower lies above the black cloud which plagues this
land, and the sun reflects its bright yellow rays from the blanket of smog
stretched out before you.  Far to the west lies a huge range of white mountains
which tower ominously above this large peak, and behind the mountains a hint
of deep blue suggests the existence of an ocean.  To the east a deafening, dull
roar echoes from a dark cave.

Lair of the Dragon^
   You enter a huge chamber which appears to house the beast, and destroyer
of this realm.  The air here seems to glow red hot, and the walls of this place
are scorched a shade of black darker than the darkest night.
   To the east lies a small chamber, and the outside air lies to the west.

   This is a small stream which flows from east to west through a low cavern.
The water in this cavern glows as if it were liquid energy.  The air here is
charged with the kind of excitement that one finds after a spring thunderstorm.
   To the west lies a large cavern which is filled with a light so bright it
seems to blot out its dark walls.

Beneath the Thunder^
   You stand at the base of a huge waterfall which cascades down from high
above into a small deep pool.  The water here is crystal clear, and seems to
glow with a brilliant white light which covers the entire room and shines
through the mist of the waterfall to form a rainbow which arcs across the
entire cavern.  The water from the pool flows to the west through a small
cavern.

Standing on a Beach^
   You stand at the edge of a deep, blue sea; waves beat endlessly on
the bone-white sand upon these shores.
   To the west, a column of water rises from the ocean, and dissapears into a
bright, white porthole.  The beach stretches out before you, along the edges
of a towering mountain range lining its shores.  To the east, a small cave
leads into the side of the cliff.
