                            &+B-----------------

Defeat the evil sorceror, Shazareth, who lives in the black tower, figure
out a way to loot his treasure room, and bring back proof.  A wise man
who lives near the cliff window may be able to assist you in finding a
way into the tower, but be forewarned...the way out is not so simple.  As
a bonus in this quest, figure out how to charge the wand of invisibility.
