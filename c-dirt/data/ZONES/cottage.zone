Serene Valley^
   This valley, nestled amidst the surrounding peaks, is a place of serene
tranquility.  Long swaths of green mountain grass beckon you to kick off
your boots and frolic about.  A branch of the valley extends to the north, and
you can return to the more mountainous regions lying to the east.  Going west
will take you back to the crossroads.

Peaceful Valley^
   You have entered a small valley snuggled amidst the towering peaks.  It
is so peaceful you can not help but smile just from being here.  Animals of all
kinds play about you, some even cautiously approach, their eyes aglow with
curiosity.
   To the north stands a cozy cottage surrounded by a white picket fence, and
adorned with several neatly trimmed hedges.  The main branch of the valley lies
to the south, and you may be able to slide down into a ledge to the east.

Front Porch^

flower-lined walk heads east to a short driveway, while a peaceful valley
becons southward.

Living Room^
   You have entered the living room of the quaint cottage, the housewife
is here busily sweeping.  A family sized color television sits here opposite
a comfy, blue sofa with enormous cushions.  the smell of baking wafts from
a tiny kitchen to the east, and you may also return south to the porch.

a small door leads east.

Garage^
   This is a clean, well kept garage.  A large, cherry-red, Plymouth Fury

make out a set of runes spelling "Christine".  There are a few dozen
different tools hanging here, but their purposes are beyond your

Cliff Turn^
   You stand on a narrow ledge, your back to the cliff face.  Above
you can see the top of the cliff, but there is no way to climb up.  Silver
mists obsucre the bottom of the chasm far below.  It is here that the wide
ledge to the south meets up with a very narrow ledge to the east.

Collapsing Ledge^
   The ledge narrows here to an untraversable width.  As you attempt to
turn and make your way back up to the west, the ledge collapses.  You are

   Standing on a ledge running north and south a few feet below the

a bridge spanning the chasm are barely visible to the south.

   Everything here seems to be expanded to a grand scale;  easily twice

   The first thing that you notice upon entering this room is the heavy

steeply downward to the south, but you can not see what lies that way, for it
is too dark.  A rectangle of light pours in from the western passage.

   The damp passage ends here, leading down into an underground resevoir.
The sound of running water echoes out of the darkness.  The large shape
of a forgotten dam looms out of the darkness to the south.

Still Water^
   You're knee-deep in the still waters of the underground resevoir.
These waters extend west around a bend lying to the south.

Still Water^
   You're waist-deep in the dark still waters of an underground resevoir.
The artificial lake extends to the north, around a bend lying to the east.
You can also climb up to the top of the dam, but climbin back down looks
almost impossible.

Top of Dam^
   Standing atop the underground dam you can peer over the rusted
guardrail to the south, but the dam's bottom is hidden in blackness.
The resevoir lies to the north; from here you can see a narrow staircase
down, which continues below the waterline.  A large rusted release
wheel protrudes from a mass of pipes nearby.

Resevoir Bottom^
   As you stand on the muddy bottom of the resevoir you are able to
see where an underground stream fed the resevoir from the west.  Picking
your way eastward across a large jumble of stones you could probably
make your way out of this muddy area, or you could return to the heights
of the dam by ascending the narrow stair.
There are some ancient runes here that catch your eye.

Lost Cavern^
   Water runs in rivulets down the walls of this cave, feeding the
stream which meanders eastward toward the damn.  the western wall of
this forgotten cave has been cut smooth and adorned with magnificent
carvings.  In the midst of these carvings stands an ornately wrought
golden door, covered in runes.  You seem to feel strange emanations of
magic brush your consciousness from somewhere behind the golden portal.

Tomb of Ramses IV^
   Rising all about you, you see jeweled panel and statues adorned
with heiroglyphics and carvings of all kinds.  Dominating this room
however, is the immense sarcophagus of The Pharoh Ramses IV.  It
emanates tendrils of magical energy which seem to reach into your soul
intently searching for you know not what.  After a moment you realize that
this room is incredibly dry, especially in comparison to the one that
you just left.
