hours spent practicing alchemy brought out his passion, while the other,
Draknor prefered much darker, more powerful magics.  My good brother and I
have kept Draknor from destroying this land.  But we grow old and tired, and
can no longer stand up to his powerful magics.  Will you help us defeat him?
We cannot journey with you, but if you bring me the means necessary to grow

Rolling Hills^
You are standing atop of the first in a series of many rolling hills that
continue on to the south.  The smell of grass and flowers fills your lungs.
The sight is very breath-taking.  On ahead in the distance is a very large
mountain range that juts up seemingly out of nowhere.  The mountains look
more unnatural than normal mountains.  They appear as if they were the work
of a demented god.

   You continue south through these breathtaking hills, the sun is setting
to the west creating a beautiful backdrop that clashes with the spindery,
and demented mountains to the south.  To the west is a forest of redwoods
thrusting up into the heavens.  To the east the land leves out into a
pasture, and beyond that, a swamp.

   As you enter this thickly wooded forest you get the eerie feeling that
you are being watched.  The forest looms overhead, making you feel very
small compared to the size of these ancient trees.  To the west the forest
continues, and to the east the beautiful hills beckon.

deeper into this forest, is it a sense of adventurism, or a thirst for the
unknown?

magical runes of all kinds, you can recognize only a few, those of protection
and warding. Skeletons hang from the walls, some from creatures you recognize,
and others you could only guess as to their origin.  Black streaks line the
walls too, possibly from long battles with demons only a crazed evil mage
would summon onto this plane...
