Rocky Buttress^
    You are making your way around a shoulder of the mountain, perched somewhat
precariously on a narrow ledge which ends to the west.  Unless you head back on
to the path just east of you, the only other way seems to be a scramble down
a gully to the south.  The going will be tricky, but not impossible, and your
return ascent would appear to be manageable.

Gully^
    The mountain looms above you as you struggle to keep your footing in this
small gully, which above you climbs steeply up to the path by which you came
here, and levels off just below you.  At this point the gradient is still quite
steep, and gorse bushes clinging to the slope grow out at an angle.  There is
little else in the way of vegetation though, and your way is relatively
unencumbered.  To the south, still some way below you, a little-used path
begins, winding westwards.

End Of The Road^
    Once upon a time this was obviously a popular road between neighbouring
villages, yet now it has been allowed to become overgrown with weeds.  To the
east a tall hedge has sprung up, completely blocking the way.  You cannot help
wondering if it was planted on purpose.  The road continues to the west.

Disused Road^
    You are progressing along an old road, once busy with traffic, now grass-
covered and forgotten.  It continues east and west from here, but to the west
it crosses a swiftly-moving river which hurries by as if anxious to leave the
area as soon as possible.  There is a bridge over the river, and a decaying
pier to the north of the bridge suggests that there was once some traffic along
the river, although you cannot imagine how any boat could possibly travel
upstream from here.

Wooden Bridge^
    You are on the bridge, looking down into the fast-flowing waters.  The
bridge crosses the river at a point where the river is curving round in a wide
arc which begins north-west of here.  From the bridge onwards it straightens
out and for a long while heads more or less due south.  To the east the old
road heads along the foot of the mountain, and to the west is the ever-open
gate of the small village of Yorrin.

Rotting Pier^
    Whether once river barges made the long haul up the river from here, or
merely traded with downstream ports, you have no idea, but you are certain of
one thing: this pier has not been in use for a good century or more.  Dank
mosses cling to the rotting planks, and most of the wooden supports are missing
or broken beyond repair.  Sheltered under the shoulder of the mountain as this
is, with the river on the one hand, there is nowhere you can go from here
except back to the south.

Village Gate^
    You are at the north-eastern gate of the village of Yorrin.  As you look
around, you are somewhat surprised to note a distinct lack of activity.  The
place is as silent as the grave, and a shiver runs up and down your spine as
you pause to consider what could possibly be the explanation for this.  To the
west is the village's main street.

Main Street^
    You are at the north end of Yorrin's main street, which runs south from
here into the centre of the village.  Yorrin is large for a village, yet the
presence of a town hall to the west amuses you by its pretentiousness.

Town Hall^
    The town hall is cold and dusty.  It shows signs of having been ransacked.
Broken bits of furniture lie scattered over the floor.  Nothing of value has
been left here.  A staircase in one corner leads up to the quarters of Yorrin's
mayor.

Mayor's Home^
    You are in the front hall of the mayor's home.  All the doors leading off
from here are locked and barred.  You wonder what has happened here, and what
might make the mayor so scared as to take such extravagant precautions.

Centre Of Yorrin^
    You are in the village centre.  Here you are most struck by the silence and
the emptiness.  The houses and shops all around you have their doors locked and
bolted, and their windows shuttered.  Except, however, for a small weapons shop
to the east which appears still to be in business.

Weapons Shop^
    You are disappointed when you enter here, for nothing remains on the walls
of what may once have been a proud selection of weaponry.  Hooks and shelves
are bare and whatever treasures they once bore is now a matter for guesswork
only.

South Gate Of Yorrin^
    You are at the southern end of the village of Yorrin.  A gate once stood
here between two tall stone pillars.  Now it is lying on the ground, smashed,
its bars bent and broken.  To the west, through the gate, you espy a small
patch of woodland, nestling under the looming bulk of a volcano.  A dark column
of smoke rises from the summit of the volcano, and you grow uneasy at the
thought of approaching it any closer.

Edge Of Yorrin Wood^
    You are at the northern edge of a wood which continues south and west from
here.  The trees are widely-spaced and dainty of stature, and therefore more
friendly and less intimidating than most of the woods you have recently had
occasion to pass through.  The broken gates of the village of Yorrin lie to the
west.

    You are at the southern edge of the wood.  To the south the river, curling
around from the east, runs approximately due west, passing under the shadow of
the great volcano.  A narrow rope bridge spans the river, and on the other side
you see a broad road leading south between an imposing pair of iron gates into
the ever-changing town of the wizards of Crossroads MUD.

    You are standing by the edge of the river, watching as it tumbles over
boulders and pours over jutting lips of bedrock, making its way rapidly towards
the southern sea.  To the north and west lie trees upon trees, low-growing and
densely foliated.  The scenery is delightful, and would be perfect if it were
not for the distinct tinge of sulphur in the air.

Yorrin Wood^
    You are in a small open glade, where no trees are growing due to the poor
quality of the soil here, which is suffused with a yellow tint that indicates
the presence of sulphur.  Whether it has boiled up from beneath at some point
or fallen from above you cannot tell, but it effectively prevents any plants
from growing within an area of twenty square yards or more.

Southern Edge Of The Wood^
    The trees come to an end here, stopping short a little way from the river

entranceway to the west.

Entrance To Bandilbar^
    You are standing beneath a low arch marking the entrance to the network of

towards you from within.  To the east the cave continues, while west of here a
paved path leads down towards a deep channel running along the foot of the
mountain.

Crossroads Of Tunnels^
    You have come to a place where two tunnels meet.  The main tunnel leading
from the entrance descends in a steep decline to the west, while the tunnel
running across from north to south is somewhat smaller and the walls less
well-hewn.  Torches line the walls down every tunnel, and you have no problem
seeing where you are going.

Narrowing Tunnel^
    You are travelling along a tunnel which grows narrower as it heads east.
Ahead in that direction you can see that it bends around to the left, heading
west.  To the west is a four-way junction, and you can see cast on to the floor
there a faint patch of natural light.

Narrow Bend^
    You are at a very tight corner of the tunnel.  To the north, a little way
off, the passage ends in a rough, unfinished wall of rock.  You surmise that
whoever dug these tunnels ceased their work before this section was finished.
The only other exit is west back to the crossroads.

Dead End^
    You have come to the end of the tunnel.  A small pile of rubble lies at the

not even time to clear away the debris.

Corner^
    You are at a corner of the tunnel.  This area is obviously frequently used,

tunnels.

Cavern Of The Worker Ants^
    This is a curious place indeed.  The cavern is vast, and in crossing it you
merely skirt around the northern wall.  Elsewhere in the cavern many strange
things are happening.  Giant ants tend even larger grubs, feeding them with
piles of green leaves and being rewarded in turn by sticky secretions produced
by the grubs.  Most of the ants fortunately seem far too busy to notice you.

Honey Pool^
    You are at the west end of the cavern.  A deep trough has been dug into the

somewhat surprised to discover that it seems to be honey, or something very
similar.  A flight of steps leads down to the north.

Foot Of The Steps^
    You are at a bend in the tunnel.  A short flight of steps leads up into

rises steeply towards the entrance to the caves.

tunnel a flight of steps leads upwards to the south.

Royal Tunnel^

storage jars, each smelling vaguely of honey.  You can hear faint voices
coming from beyond the north wall.

wonder if you will be swept all the way down to the sea.  Suddenly, however,
you are winded by a hard thud as you collide with a wooden post sticking out
of the water.  You cling to it like a drowned rat, and when you have recovered
somewhat you realise that it is the remnants of an old wooden pier that you
have washed up against.
