lflags {Outdoors}
Misty Moorland^
   You are standing on the south-eastern edge of a vast tract of misty, tangled
moorland.  Thick gorse and bracken make travel almost impossible save for
narrow, animal-worn tracks to the north and east.

Misty2 n:Circle w:Misty1 ;

lflags {Outdoors}
Misty Moorland^
   You are wandering amidst the thickets and stones far out upon the moor. Grey
and barren they extend all around you.  Thick gorse and bushes prevent even the
most determined adventurer from doing anything but following the paths to the
north and west.
^
pit n:Lost1 d:^RopeTopPit;
Altitude = 900
lflags {Outdoors}
By The Pit^
   You are standing on the rim of a huge open pit looking down some twenty feet
to the floor below.  The walls of the pit are too sheer to climb down, which is
unfortunate as there seem to be caves leading off from it.  A path winds its
dusty way north out onto the moor.
^
Edge n:Rocky e:Circle s:Misty1;
Altitude = 900
lflags {Outdoors}
Western Edge Of Moor^
   You are standing somewhere near the western edge of the moors.  Narrow,
gorse-walled paths wind their narrow ways north east and south from here.
^
Circle n:Lost2 e:Lost1 s:Misty2 w:Edge;
Altitude = 900
lflags {Outdoors}
The Stone Circle On The Moor^
   You are standing in the center of an ancient circle of jagged stones hidden
in a deep bowl in the center of the moors.  Narrow scarcely used tracks wind up
from the deathly quiet bowl.  The center of the circle is a black gloomy altar
to some ancient god.
^
Lost1 n:Lost2 e:pit s:Misty2 w:Edge;

lflags {Outdoors}
Lost On The Moor^
   You are lost on the moor.  Thick gorse and tangled bushes prevent you from
seeing far in any direction.  A multitude of little twisted paths wind in all
directions from here.
^
Cottage n:Waste e:Inside w:Lost1;
Altitude = 900
lflags {Outdoors}
By The Ruined Cottage^
   You are standing somewhere on the eastern side of the moor.  A narrow worn
path leads east between two crumbling dry-stone walls towards the remains of an
old cottage.

lflags {Outdoors}
Inside The Ruined Cottage^
   You are standing in the sad, desolate ruins of an old farmhouse.  The roof
has long since caved in, leaving a crumbling shell to gradually fall.  A single
doorway leads west back outside onto the moor.

Rocky Waste^
   You are standing on the northeastern corner of the moor, looking out across
a mass of jumbled rock.  Paths lead south and west across the moor, while the
rock steepens into preciptious cliffs to the east and north, preventing further
travels.
^
Lost2 e:Waste s:Lost1 w:Rocky ;

lflags {Outdoors}
Lost On The Moor^
   You are lost somewhere on a vast expanse of ancient moorlands.  Thick
bushes and tangled piles of gorse and rock prevent you from seeing far in any
direction, though narrow paths wind east, west and south across the moor.

Rocky End^
   The path you are following across the moor ends here, in a narrow rocky
hollow.  Another narrow path leads northwards, and you espy a great castle in
the distance.
