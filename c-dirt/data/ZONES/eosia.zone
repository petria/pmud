The cover reads 'The History of the Bhelliom'.  It appears that the
troll Ghwerig once combined all the powers of the Troll Gods into the
magical stone, the Bhelliom.  In order to get or use the Bhelliom, one must
be in possession of the two keys to activate it.  These keys were made in
the form of two ruby rings.  Where those rings are today is a mystery.
However, the Bhelliom was stolen by a human, and then lost in one of the great
battles during one of the many wars between the Elenes and the Zemochs.  It is
believed Ghwerig recovered the Bhellim  at some point, but it is unknown.
There are references to the gods of the Styrics, in particular, the Goddess
Aphrael, and the God Azash...but as a faithful Elene, you tend not to believe
such fables.

        You have come to a 4 way intersection on the road.  The roads

The Road to Cimmura^
        The road bends here, leading north to the capital of Elenia, the

The Inn^
        This is one of the more unsavory places to visit in Cimmura.  Known
for its fights, and wild times, this establishment has been on the royal
condemnation list for years.  However, thanks to the local Thieves, it has
maintained its own existance.  The Inn is closed right now, but perhaps

Thieves' Guild^
        You stand in the local chapter of the Thieves' Guild.  Here is where
all of the local thieves, from cut-throat thieves to small pick pockets,
meet and discuss business.  You can just barely make out sounds from the Inn
upstairs coming through the ceiling.  Looking about you see many of the
items 'obtained' by the thieves during thier normal working hours.  A banner
hangs on the far wall stating 'Congratulations Seamas and Traveller on your 
100+ thefts.'  The only exit is up.

The Pandion Chapterhouse^
        ...is almost the size of the royal castle itself.  More of a keep
than a castle, the chapterhouse is the home of the Pandion knights in
Cimmura.  You stand in the main hall of the building now.  All about you
stand suits of armor, each one belonging to a famous Cimmurian Pandion.  The
most famous, of course, is Sir Sparhawk, Champion to Queen Ehlana.  Knights
block every exits except the one to the west.

The Castle Gates^
        Large golden gates mark the entrance to the Royal Castle of
Cimmura.  The crest of Elenia is emblazed on each gate.  Currently
the castle is home to the Royal Council, ruling in Queen Ehlana's
place while she is ill.  The council has named the Prince Reagent heir
and he is planning to assume the throne within the week.  Just beyond
the gates lies the main courtyard and then, the castle itself.

        Your footsteps echo on the marble flooring of the castle.  Massive
pillars stretch up into the darkness, supporting the massive ceiling.  Banners
hang from the walls, and you think you might even recognize some of them.  The
castle has fallen into a state of decay ever since Queen Ehlana fell ill.  Dust
now gathers on the suits of armor and cobwebs can be seen in the corners.  Even
though you appear to be quite alone, you think you can see a shadow flickering
just beyond the edge of your vision.

Elenia's Throne Room^
        From this room Queen Ehlana used to rule the whole Kingdom of Elenia.
Now, it lies empty, sealed by order of Primate Annias.  The air is cold
and stale, and you suspect no one has been in this room for months.  A sound
catches your attention, but when you look, there is nothing there.  A sadness
fills the room, and in the silence, you can just make out a heartbeat.  A chill
fills you to the bone when you realize that what you hear is the heartbeat
of Queen Ehlana, encased in crystal in the front of the room.

The Royal Council's Chambers^
        This room looks like it has been used a lot recently.  This is where
the Royal governing council of Elenia has been meeting while Ehlana has been
ill.  Papers, maps, and books lay strewn about in a disarray, almost as if
someone had been searching for something.  Glancing at one of documents you
are startled to discover that Primate Annias, a churchman, was responsible
for the poisoning of Ehlana.  It seems Annias wants to become Archprelate
of the Church, and poisoned Ehlana to gain access to the Elenian treasury.
Sephrenia and a handful of Pandion Knights sealed Ehlana in crystal in the
hopes of keeping her alive until a cure could be found to save her.  There is
no sign as to where any of them have gone.

        This is were the Kings and Queens of Elenia have been buried over
the centuries.  The crypt extends back into the darkness.  The room
is cold and dank, and you would rather not be down here, given the choice.
Many coffins stand along the walls, each with the name of its occupant on
the cover.  Perhaps if you stay long enough, maybe you will see the ghost
of the last king to sit on the throne of Elenia.

that education.  The Lady Sephrenia was the teacher for most of the Pandions,
and they hold her in the highest regard.  This room was built to help
protect the Styrics from the less tolerant Elenes who would rather have all
Styrics killed.  This simple room has a bed and table and not much else.

Ghwerig's Cave^
        You stand in one of the messiest room's you have ever seen.  This
is the home of the insane troll, Ghwerig.  After having locked himself
away with the Bhelliom, Ghwerig went utterly insane.  Rags, various pieces
of metal and other nick-nacks lay strewn about on the floor.  You feel very
claustrophobic in here.  The ceiling appears as if it wants to collapse!

A Troll's Treasure^
        This is Ghwerig's treasure room.  The cavern sparkles from the light
cast by your light source.  Jewels, gold, silks and more are piled as
far as you can see.  Ghwerig obviously has been a busy little gatherer.  A
pedestal stands before you, maybe its just the light, but there appears to
be something on it...
