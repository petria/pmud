splitting to the south and east, where it heads into a small ravine.

Rocky Trail^
        You are walking along a rocky trail which winds its way through the

pitched wail as it rushes through the hills.

it whips at your clothes and hair.  The trail leads west and north, towards

debris lies at the end of a long gouge in the ground.

torch from it.  The temple continues to the south.

        This is the highest point in the southern mountain range.  From here,
you see the lands of Mirage laid out like a map.  The mountains continue to        
the west, where they turn north and bisect the forest.  A dwarven citadel is
visible in the far northwestern corner of the range.  To the direct north are
the plains, followed by woodlands.  A small village is visible beyond that,
resting on the edge of an eternal snowstorm.  To the east is the shoreline of
a vast sea, speckled with tiny islands.  A set of stairs lead down here,
while an altar is visible to the north.
