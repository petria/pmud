A Sleepy Bank^
You stand on the bank of a gently flowing river. Daisies grow all
around you, soaking up the warm summer sun. Their smell is quite
intoxicating, and makes you feel quite relaxed. A large oak tree
rises from the bank, spreading its branches wide to provide shade
for anyone who wishes to curl up at its base and rest for awhile.
Just as you decide to take a nap in these Elysian surroundings, a
white rabbit with pink eyes runs past you muttering to itself and
vanishes to the east. In the direction that it disappeared you see a
large hole in the ground. To the west is the door to the library, and
the paths to the north and south don't seem to go anywhere.

The Edge of the Hole^
You stand in front of a hole, set into the side of a hill. Except for its

Down the Hole^
The rabbit hole goes straight, like a tunnel, for a few feet, and then

The door leads into a large kitchen, which is full of smoke from one

middle, nursing a baby. A second woman leans over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seems to be full of soup. The scent
of pepper hangs heavily in the air, and a jar of it stands alone on a

Marooner's Rock is a large rock sticking out of the lagoon. It is so

Emerald Bedroom^
You are in what was once described as 'the sweetest little room in
the world', with a soft, comfortable bed that has sheets of green
silk and a green velvet counterpane. There is a tiny fountain in the
middle of the room, that shoots a spray of green perfume into the
air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin.
Beautiful green flowers stand in the windows, and there is a shelf
with a row of little green books. A staircase leads down.

Western Path^
Walking over fields of soft green grass dotted here and there with
daisies and buttercups, you see a sign that points to the west.
The sign tells you that that is the direction towards the castle of 
the Wicked Witch of the West, and you recall hearing a rumor that
she has reportedly enslaved all trespassers. The path also goes east
to the yellow brick road.

Fields^
The ground here is rough and hilly. There are no farms or houses

Forest^
You stand at the entrance to the dark forest of the west. To the
east are some fields. As soon as you step beneath the canopy of
trees, the sun vanishes as though someone turned it off. It is 
rumored that packs of wolves, swarms of bees, and flocks of
crows monitor the forest to prevent visitors from reaching the
Witch's castle.

Winkie Village^
You stand in the village of the Winkies, the Munchkins of the west.
They are cowardly people who do only what they are told. They roam
the area dressed in leather armor and carry spears, so that no-one
wants to speak to them and maybe tell them to do something. The path 
goes east and west from here.

The light ahead seems to indicate an end to the trees which you have

Rocky Lands^
The path here wanders east and west through a field of rocks. 
Sharp stones are underfoot, as well as larger boulders, the 
largest the size of your head. A few corpses are scattered
around here, covered with dented armor. Blood has stained 
the stones red, as well as the clay.

Yellow Castle^
You stand before the gates of the Yellow Castle. Here it is rumored
that the wicked witch of the west lives. Of course, you know how
reliable rumors are. The castle is painted a shade of yellow which
you can neither name nor recognize. The walls are high, and the
windows pointed. The path goes east and west.

Courtyard^
You stand on the cobbled stones of the yellow courtyard. The walls
seem to glow with an un-earthly light, washing out your features
and making your skin turn orange. From here you can go up to
Dorothy's room, out to the exercise yard to the south, or to the
kitchen to the north. The exit from the building is to the east.

Kitchen^
You enter the kitchen. Workers scatter at your approach, in fear
of their Witch's wrath falling on them for even looking for you.
Food lies in various states of preparation on the tables and
counters, and you are suddenly filled with hunger. The exit is

Dorothy's room is the prime tourist attraction at this castle.
It is decorated in pink and white, and is the only room here which
is not colored yellow. In fact, there is no yellow in the whole room.

Wall^
A huge wall stands here, built among the trees. It is made of clay
laid over tall trees, and looks thick enough to support people
standing on top of it. Fortunately, there is a ladder here to assist
you in case you want to climb it. The path goes north from here.

Atop the Wall^
You stand atop the wall, looking into the yard beyond. Before you is
a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and
white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around are many
houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colours.
These houses are quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as
high as your waist. There are also pretty little barns, with china
fences around them, and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs
and chickens, all made of china, standing around in groups. But the
strangest of all are the people who live in this queer country. There
are milk-maids and shepherdesses, with bright-colored bodices and
golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most
gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed
in knee-breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them,
and golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jewelled crowns
upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny
clowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and
tall, pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people are all made
of china, even to their clothes, and are so small that the tallest of
them is no higher than your knee. A ladder leads down to the China
Land, and up to a strange path.

The trees seems to be normal here, not nearly as vicious as

Throne Room^
Your breath is taken away by the sight of the crystal room which you
now stand in. Everything in the room is made of crystal, shining in
the light which comes from the diamonds in the ceiling. Sitting in
the crystal throne which dominates the opposite wall is Glinda, the
Good Witch. Her shining gown dazzles you with its brilliance, and
she asks if you are ready to go home yet. She waves a hand, and a
hole appears in front of her. Down the hole, you can see a library.
An exit goes north.
