Sky Solar^
     Stepping inside, you find yourself surrounded by lush, exotic
greenery.  Overhead, you can see a great expanse of sky and traces of
clouds through the glass dome.  The scent of tropical flowers fill your
senses as you are soothed by the soft songs of birds flitting amid the
foliage.  In the center of the room, you see long, low, comfortable
looking divans that invite you to rest your travel-weary body.  On a
marble table near one of the divans, sits a crystal bowl filled with
plump, glistening strawberries.  Next to the bowl is a chafing dish
holding some warm, smooth, liquid chocolate.
     The whisper of water draws your gaze to a natural rock waterfall
that spills into a deep, crystal-clear pool.  A hint of steam rising from
the surface tells you the water will be warm, soothing and most inviting.
  There are exits to the west and south.

The Emerald Cloud^
    You have now somehow reached the Emerald Cloud, a brilliant crystaline forma
tion floating here in the Heavens.  You are standing on pure emerald, which is s
praying a ten foot radius of soft, green light.  You gaze in wonder at how this
beauty could possibly be.
    In the center of this flying wonder, a small hot springs is dug in, letting
off traces of hot wavering steam.  Two small emerald pillars stand next to it, e
ach supporting one side of a comfortable looking hammock.
    You get a peaceful feeling being suspended in free space.  Looking up, the s
tars seem even more brilliant than on the clearest night.  Peering down, a chill
 runs down your spine as you realize just how far above the lands of Crossroads
you really are.

Sadie's Room^
As you wander across a beautiful stretch of beach, you spy a lonely beach
house. Your curiousity draws you inside.  Once there you are amazed with
the beauty and peacfulness you find.  On the West wall you see nothing but
windows looking out over the most beautiful ocean you have ever seen.  The
waters are so blue, it seems like the sky has come down to touch the edge
of the earth. There is a lit fireplace, with burning logs crackling. 
There are candles burning on the mantle produce a peaceful dim atmosphere
about the room.  In the shadows of light you see a soft white bear skin
rug in front of the fireplace. Soft music is playing.  You feel so at ease
here.  It would be easy to fall fast asleep if not careful. This place must
belong to someone who loves the ocean very much.  
As you lie by the fire you hear the faint roar of the ocean waves outside.

     The grassy field that you have entered makes you feel lonely. You
wonder what kind of Chump makes this place their home. The southern path
leads back to civilization whille to the north you see a lake. You begin to
feel lost and confused when you peer at the lake in the distance for too
long. Maybe you should return the way you came and seek adventure
elsewhere.

like the rosetta stone and the Sarcophagus of King Tut. On the desk you see a
computer unlike any you have ever seen before, it has no moniter just a little

Tinky's Room^
  As you approach this small abode, you can't help but wonder how someone could
live in a home so small.  As you walk through the yellowwood entry, though, 
you gasp in amazement.  This place is HUGE!  Plush red carpeting stretches
away to the far wall stopping only to scuttle under the large comforting easy
chairs and sofas.  Red and yellow roses sit before a magnificent picture window
revealing a splendid view of the cool blue ocean below.  All in all, it looks
like a very nice place to kick back, relax, and talk to your favourite person 
for hours on end!
