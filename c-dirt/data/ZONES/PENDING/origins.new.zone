Status: R

New zone file. :)

Changes:

1. Sign is now at END, displaying credits...not required to enter zone.
   Less rude and Rush obvious this way.
2. Changed descs on Alex and Geddy...changed their roles to fit the
   zone, not the band.
3. Changed item descs on bass and guitar.  They are now ancient magical
   instruments, not electric and modern.
4. Changed Rush song displayed  from YYZ to a simple madrigal. (more
   medieval.)
5. Changed starting location of bass... :)
6. Changed game displays when bass is given to Geddy Lee; now every-
   thing involves magic.

				Should be better now...

of the Outer Planets, we have had peace since the year 2062, when
the surviving planets were banded together under the &+rRed Star&n of
the Solar Federation.  The less fortunate gave us a few new
moons.  Today, this fragile peace comes to an end as Father Brown
and his forces end Jon's life.

priests of the Temples to ally with a being from the past to 
prevent the evolution of music.  This way, the Temples' music

        You stand at the beginning of a fantastic forest,  whose
very trees seem to be as old as the earth they grow from.
Despite the density of the foliage, the sunlight shines through

surrounds everything here.  Through them, you can see the fabled
elven town.  You doubt you've ever seen anything this magnificent

The City of Rivendell^
        The marvel of this city's architecture only increases as
your eyes get closer to it.  The homes all about you are shaped,
not built from the wood of the trees, and are thus part of them.
Sunlight is captured beautifully by a crystal arch spanning the
entire city from your left to right, and it is focused
miraculously into one spot in the center of the city.
        All around you are numerous elven dwellings.  Yet the
city seems oddly quiet for so large an area, and so merry a
people...
        You see mumerous destroyed musical instruments littering
the streets; lyres with broken strings, recorders and flutes with
shattered bodies, and drums with broken heads.
        There is a door to your right, leading to a large elven
home, and a large threshold to your left.  The city continues on
to the north.

leads east back into the city.

The Center of the City^
        You are standing directly beneath the beautiful arch.
The sunlight shines down directly upon you, granting a soothing,
relaxing feeling.
        Due north, you see that a great black chasm has ripped
the earth apart from the westernmost position of the city to it's
easternmost.  It appears to be very deep and dangerous to
negotiate.
^
/*Here, the player must "wave staff" (the staff from origins13)
to proceed further.  When this is done:

  'You wave the staff underneath the arch.  The sunlight streams
   down from it and enters the top of your staff!'

(the character is then transported to origins16)*/

The Mountain in the East^
        The light from the staff increases in magnitude until all
you can see is a blinding white light and all you can hear in
your head are the words 'Draw towards the fountain'.
        But soon the sound dies down and the light gives way to a
most soothing and pastoral scene.  You stand high atop a mountain,
overlooking a vast ocean to the west and a beautiful sylvan forest
in all other directions.  The sheer natural beauty of this place,
so pure and relaxing it is, has you in a total state of
relaxation.  From here, you can see the whole world it seems, and
you feel invincible, almost immortal...
        Above you and slightly to the east, you hear the sounds of
running water, and a mysterious, sultry voice beckons to you.
"Come up," the voice soothes.
^
/*There will be a mobile named Geddy Lee and a bass from 
origins12 here. (see above). The whole point of this is for the
player to give the bass to Geddy Lee.  If this is done, have the
game say:

 'Geddius Lee thanks you, waves his hands in magical gestures,
  and the bass begins to play itself!  As it does so, the bridge
  is miraculousy lowered!'

At this point, a message should be delivered to EVERYONE saying:

 'In the distance you hear a stirring "&+WMadrigal.&n"'

(like when you give the bagpipes to the piper!)  Geddy Lee will
now automatically WIELD the bass.

NOW the state of the bridge will be changed so as to 'raise' it and allow

out of the very bowels of the mountain itself.  The water in the
fountain is perfectly crystal clear, and seems to glow white.
        The view here is even more spectacular than the one
before, with the fountain and waterfall only enhancing its marvel.
You want to stay here forever...

        Fighting back to consciousness, coldness grips your skin.
It suddenly becomes obvious to you that Panacea and Geddy Lee
have sent you here for a reason.  All around you, trees hang
somberly about you, much resembling the the willowy trees of
swamps.  You can't help but feel that the trees are watching your

save for a bridge that is guarded by a wispy, shadowy form.
The figure moans, 'Stay back or die...'  Its very voice

away wish you hadn't.  Cries of anguish from stricken mothers
and children pervade the heavy gloom.  Depression falls heavier
than a thick mantle here.
        There is not much to see, as all the homes and buildings
have been shattered.  The dreary path turns south towards a large
castle, north into hellish woods, east towards dead land, or
offers passage to the west back across the river.

Lands Stripped Bare^
        This area east of Willowdale must once have been where
the inhabitants of the city did their farming.  But now, the once
rich and fertile earth has been violently stripped of all
semblance of fertility.  It reminds you of deliberately washing
salt into soil to make it infertile, only this is far worse.
        The very life essence of the area is gone, leaving a
cold, hard, empty shell.  Clothes may warm the body, but they do
not warm the soul...
        In front of you is a small mountain which appears to have
some greenery growing on it, and doesn't appear difficult to
climb.

small mountain.

        As grey traces of dawn tinge the eastern sky, you emerge
from the forest shadow, ford the River Don, and leave the trodden
town of Willowdale.
        You turn south, journeying into the dark and forbidding
lands of the Necromancer.  Even now, the intensity of his dread
power can be felt, weakening the body and saddening the heart.
        You reflect upon the empty, mindless spectres, stripped
of will and soul.  Only your thirst to aid the elves of Rivendell
gives you hunger for vengeance...

        You arrive at the base of one of the great towers which
dominate the castle's exterior.  The walls of the tower are
covered with moss and and decay, and a vile stench pervades the

        You climb the long flight of steps, heading toward the
zenith, and the climb is a long and tedious one.  The stairs
squeak loudly as you tread upon them.  You pray that the fragile
stairs don't crumble underneath your feet.  As you reach the top,
you see a door.  Optionally, you may head back down the stairs.

The Necromancer's Room^
        You enter a small chamber, filled to the brim with test
tubes, distillation tubes, decanters, flasks, and various other
equipment an evil, dark mage would have.  Numerous volumes of the
"Arcanum Magicana Disciplina," penned by the greatest Dark Mage,
the legendary &+LSuraklin&n himself, rest on the bookshelf.  You 
stare in abject horror; how could one live for so long in such a 
small room, with so little remaining space? But the answer to 
that is painfully obvious: the Necromancer stopped 'living' in 
days long since past...
^
/*There is a bookshelf in this room, as per %objects.  It can be
pushed or moved, to reveal another item, a disc (also in %objects.)
When FIRST moved to state[0] (it is pushtoggle) the game should show:

 'With much heaving, you move the shelf and discover a metallic disc!'

If pushed back:

 'You slide the bookshelf back into place.'

If moved again to state[0] (after disc has been found):

 'You heave and slide the bookshelf along the wall.'

Now, note that the up exit is ^disc.  This is because when the disc is
in state[0], it is actually a cylinder.  In this state, one can go up,
much like a door.  If EXAMINED in state[1]:

 'You see a large metallic disc, of about 2 feet in diameter,
  which shines with a lovely silver glow.  It appears that you can
  open it, with a little bit of work.'

Now, EXAMINED in state[0] (cylinder mode):

 'This is a large cylinder, of about 2 feet diameter and 8 feet
  height.  It has an open threshold leading into it, raised about
  1.5 feet off the ground.'

When the disc is opened, (put to state[0]):

 'You open the disc, and it begins to grow in height into a
  cylinder!'

As soon as the disc has been opened, a new exit will appear in
room, the UP exit listed above.  When the player goes up, show
the following:

 'You step up into the cylinder, and everything begins to swirl.
  You fight for consciousness, but darkness grips you!'*/

Megadon^
        You lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon.
City and sky become one, a vast sea of unbroken grey.  The Twin
Moons, just two pale orbs as they trace their way across the sky.
You see various people 'plugging' into their machines, and
carrying Temple Papers.
        From here, you may choose to walk in any direction.  To
the north lies clearly the most important building here, a huge,
metallic structure which easily dominates the view for miles.
To the south lies the spaceport, where large vehicles capable of
flight arrive and depart regularly.  To the east is another large
edifice, and people are bustling in and out of there hurriedly.
Finally, to the west, is the single place of residence you can
recognize.  It reminds you of familiar houses at home, except
that it is made of metal.

        Upon entering this room, you feel like you are going to
faint, due to the plethora of bright lights and noise.  The
source of most of the light is row upon row upon row of large
monitors, to which many people are attached.  The images seem
quite amorphous to you, but the people using them probably see
a whole new world...
        A single western exit heads back out to Megadon.

The Only House in Sight^
        You come upon a small, metallic, domed shelter, that
appears as bleak as the entire area you are in.  There is no
concept of a 'yard' here, it would seem.  However, though you
cannot find any place to enter the house, you do hear the actual
sounds of running water to your north!  It is also possible to
return east to Megadon.
^
/*Looking at %mobiles, you will see that the Alex Lifeson mobile
is located here.  It is a special mobile.  If he is talked to, via
TELL -or- SAY, he will respond with a say (or tell, if that is the
only possibility.)  I will assume say in the colorcode below, but
this needs to be adjusted if a tell is used:

  &+WAlex Lifeson&n says '&+YJon, the leader of the rebels, has 
  been slain.  I am the only one left who can defeat Father Brown.  
  Find me a guitar and I can destroy him.&n'
(Please remember to re-enter the colorcode after a newline).

Now, the player must find the guitar (see %objects) and give it to
Alex.  ONLY WHEN this is done, continue with the following:

Have the game display:

  'Alex bows before you, thanks you, and says '&+YLeave him to me.&n'
   He then heads toward The Temple of Syrinx.'

The Alex Lifeson mobile is then transported to origins46,
The Temple of Syrinx.

Now, the game will display whatever is normally echoed to the 
whole MUD just as if a player had been slain by a mobile; use the 
colorcodes and everything.  The Father Brown mobile (above in 
%mobiles) is killed.*/

The Waterfall^
        Lo and behold!  Despite the total lack of organic
material in all of Megadon, you have arrived at a beautiful
waterfall, which gently cascades down the side of a tiny stone
mountain into a small reservoir built for the purpose of holding
the precious water.
        The road leads back south towards the house.
^
/*There is a waterfall item here.  EACH player must examine the
waterfall, in order to discover the north exit.  (Like my sign
from the very first room.)  The first time the waterfall is 
examined by EACH player, the game will display:

  'You find a small cave mouth behind the waterfall.'

Now, the 'examining' player may proceed north.*/

The Cave^
        You walk underneath the waterfall and enter a small cave.
The interior of the cave contains a bed, a table, and other small
living essentials.  It is otherwise void of anything else.  The
walls here are actual stone, not metal.
        The cave's exit is to the south, and at the far corner of
the interior, you spot a flight of steps.

&+BThe Temple of &+CSyrinx&n^
        Upon first entering this room, the bleakness of the
walls, all metallic grey, seem monotonous and foreboding.  But
upon further and closer examination, you see that these walls
pulse with life!!  Electronic signals and lights of origin
unknown convey a deep sense of mystery.  In its own way, the
machinery of the rooms is alive; electronic impulses are its
language and electricity is its oxygen...
        You get the feeling that this room and the things within
it are as old as time itself, though nothing within it has ever
been seen before.  Three elaborate thrones dominate the center of
the room, raised on a dias.  On the lowest step of the dias is
written "&+GElder Race&n".  On each of the three thrones is a single
word, beautifully rendered in flowing script.  The left throne
says "&+rRed Star&n", the right one "&+RSolar Federation&n" and 
the central throne reads "&+CSYRINX&n".  There are a myriad of 
computers, monitors, and sound equipment all over the room, all 
in perfect order.  On the floor in the very center, right below 
the dias, is a pentagram inscribed within a circle, all in red.  
The topmost point of the pentagram points directly to the central 
throne.

Temple of Syrinx, filled with large objects that fly without
effort.  You have never seen such wonder.  You are still too far
outside the Spaceport to see any more detail.
        You may return north to Megadon or enter the Spaceport to
the south.
^
/*The mobile here, T.C. Broonsie, has a BarSouth mflag.  If the
pass from origins46 is given to Broonsie, the BarSouth mflag
should be removed, and the game will simulate this in text:

Now, the player may proceed south.*/

The Spaceport^
        You enter the heart of the great Spaceport, and come face
to face with the large flying objects, which you overhear the
people refer to as 'spaceships'.  Many people embark and
disembark from these ships before your eyes.
        Most of the ships are huge, but one particularly small
one dubbed "The Rocinante" catches your eye.  There is a man at
that ship, who gestures for you to go see him.  It would also be
possible for you to head back up north toward Megadon.

Inside the Rocinante^
        You follow the man, and climb up into the ship.  Before
your eyes are huge panels on all four walls, filled with buttons
and lights you don't understand.
        The entire interior of the ship humms slightly, and you
can feel these subtle vibrations.  They tickle you.
        The man seems to understand your need to get home.  You
have one last chance to go back down, or you may press forward
and follow his lead.
^

Takeoff!^
        The ship starts to move slightly, and the slight hum you
heard increases in intensity to nearly intolerable levels!  The
ship suddenly lurches upward, and you feel like you are going to
be sick.  Your ears pop, your vision blurrs, and you feel faint.
But you know that there is no turning back now.
        As soon as the dome of the planet is cleared, you begin
to feel accustomed to the travel.  Through the windows, you can
see the very stars you saw at night back home.
        Meanwhile, brave Neil Peart tells you a story:
"&+WIn the constellation of Cygnus, there lurks a mysterious,
&+Winvisible force; the Black Hole of Cygnus X-1.  Six stars of the
&+WNorthern Cross, in mourning for their sister's loss, in a final

        But what distract your attention from all this beauty
are the scores upon scores of dead bodies of all races, which
line the road and the rest of the City.

victim to starvation, cold, and disease, while a few have
apparently been slain by weapons from the well-equipped beings.
The well-equipped bodies have obviously been slain by primitive
