&+RLandshark's home&N^
This is where landshark eats, sleeps, and, well you suppose that is all
he does here...
There are a few dictionaries on the floor, here and you only wish
that he would use them more often.
This is a simple place, messy but simple.
Clothes line the floor, and there are plates with old food lying around here
and there, you wonder who made this clown god.....

The Gods Meeting Room^
   This is a large dome shaped room, in the center of the room is a long table
with many comfortable looking chairs.
This is where the powers come for meetings and parties.
