The diary is old and many of its pages are missing.  As you read it, an
incredible tale unfolds.  The writer of the diary was part of an expedition
which set out three months ago to find El Dorado, a mythical city which
supposedly lies in the great rainforest to the south-east.  The expedition
crossed this great mountain range, then descended into the rainforest and set
out on their ambitious quest.  After some time they had a major disagreement
and the group split up, one half continuing to battle through the forest while
the other built a raft and floated down the river.  The writer of the diary was
in the party which took the slow route through the jungle.  During weeks of
fruitless searching the party gradually dwindled, one by one falling victim to
one or other of the jungle's manifold hazards.  When there were only a handful
left, they abandoned their quest and attempted to return home.  The final
entries in the diary are increasingly surreal, and it is plain that the writer
was steadily losing his grip on reality."

    The rocks here are sharp and small, yet they seem to be firmly attached and

    You are to some extent protected here by a great outthrust mass of rock

contemplate climbing down the almost vertical drop to the north.  To the south
the slope is more manageable, although your heart still pounds when you look

moraine at the edge of the glacier, a long trail of small rocks which forms a
kind of path running east and west along the glacier.  Following it would seem
to be a more sensible option than attempting a crossing here, for the surface
of the glacier is pitted with treacherous crevasses overlaid with deceptive
coverings of snow.

ominously beneath your feet, but so far it seems to be holding.  To the south
the ice looks more broken and you feel a sense of unease when you contemplate
that route.  Further downstream to the east it looks even worse.  The ice to
the west looks more stable, but by far the safest exit is that to the north,
where the moraine promises surer ground.

stand here on the bank of the Kerapi river.  Another river has just joined it
from the north, and the resultant torrent thunders past you with an almost
deafening sound.  You marvel at this mighty force of nature and at the sheer
power of the water as it bounces down the hillside, forging a channel for
itself.  You could not hope to cross here, or even enter the water, for you
would be carried away and dashed to pieces in a minute.  To the east the river
drops suddenly downhill and you can follow its bank if you wish.

Shaded Dell^
    You are in a small dell surrounded by trees.  The air is damp and fungi
thrive on the forest floor.  Trees crowd together to the south and east, making
those directions impassable.  To the north is the river.

Bank Of The Roaring River^
    You are careful not to get too close to the river's edge at this point, for
the water is so violent that its limits are not constant, and every so often a
sudden surge washes over the rocks on the river bank.  At this point the river
is descending in fits and bursts, yet to the east it seems to disappear over
the edge of a cliff.

Waterfall^
    You are at the top of a cliff, where the Kerapi river pours over the brink
and drops in one unbroken waterfall down a full five hundred feet to crash in
huge clouds of spray at the bottom, whence it calms down and begins to crawl
eastward at a far more leisurely pace.

Soaked By Spray^
    At the bottom of the waterfall the noise is terrific and you cover your
ears to protect them.  You quickly become soaked with the spray from the river
and resolve to hasten out of this area forthwith.  To the south you could head
into the forest, or you could follow the river as it wends its way east.

Southern River Bank^
    In stark contrast to the fury and energy of the waterfall to the west, this
spot is very peaceful.  The river here is flat and unbroken by rocks, although
debris from the foothills can be seen floating by here and there.  The flow is
fairly swift, but calm and smooth, and you feel yourself relaxing under its
soothing influence.

The Rainforest^
    You are deep in the rainforest.  The distant roar of a waterfall to the

insects.

Slippery Bank^
    You take care to keep away from the edge here, for the bank of the river
is muddy and you fear piranhas.  The river is wide at this point, too wide to
swim across, so unless you have a boat you will have to continue along the bank
either east or west from here.

Hardwood Trees^
    You are struck by how many different species of trees populate this forest.
In this spot you count several tall hardwood varieties, with tall unbranching
trunks that make them valuable for timber.  Lapachos, curapays and spanish
cedars are notable amongst them, but there are many more that you do not
recognise.  There are exits in all directions.

River Bank^
    You find your way blocked by a fallen tree which sticks out into the middle of the river.  You find yourself unable to climb it since its trunk is smooth

Thick Forest^
    This is a very thick part of the forest.  The trees are not noticeably
closer together, but their foliage is less dense and thus more light reaches
the ground here than did in the forest across the river.  The effect of this is
that the undergrowth flourishes, producing vast and rambling forms that
obstruct you at every turn.  To the south the way back to the river is easy
enough, while to the east you think you can manage to squeeze through the
bushes.

where caimans rest, and as you arrive a few of them slide into the water,
hopefully considering you too large to be easy prey.  At this point the river
bends gently round to the south as it goes downstream, so if you continue east
you will be heading into the jungle.  North will also take you into thicker
growth, while to the west you can follow the bank up the river again.

Southern Bank Of The Malazon^
    You are on the southern bank of the River Malazon, if bank is the right
word.  There is no dry land to be seen, only a series of soft mudbanks and
pools which are stained brown by tannin from the leaves falling into the water.
You can head east or west along the edge of the river proper, or venture south
among the pools.

South Bank^
    You are heading along the riverbank, which at this point consists of knee-

Tannin Pool^
    You are standing by the side of a large pool of water, though it may be a

you can see nothing moving in it.  It is the colour of tea but does not look
drinkable.

Raised Ground^
    You are on a patch of ground which is slightly higher than the surrounding

their unease.

Where The Hummingbirds Hum^
    This part of the forest has a quiet, ethereal quality.  You are on high

whose nectar only hummingbirds can reach.  Several of those tiny birds are
hovering around here, their humming increasing in pitch every time they move.
You can go east and west from here.

Tannin Channel^
    A brown-stained rill lies before you, its sandy floor showing pale beneath

    Water, water everywhere...  There seems to be no end of it.  This sluggish
tributary is one of the least of those you have seen, but in more temperate
climes it would not be an insignificant feature.  A dense thicket prevents you
from heading east, but you could go around it by heading south first - the
water near the shore is shallow enough to wade in.

Under The Kapok Tree^
    A terrible smell assaults your nostrils as you pause at the base of an
enormous kapok tree.  You discover, nestling between the tall thin roots of the

incredibly noxious odour.  It is a stinking corpse flower and well deserves its
name.

Bell Bird's Territory^
    You are deep within the rainforest.  As you pause here you become aware of
an at first intriguing, then after a while intensely annoying, sound.  It
sounds as if an anvil is repeatedly being struck by an hammer.  The noise is the
call of the bell bird, and it will happily spend all day sitting on its branch
high above you doing nothing else but make this strange sound.  After a short

Shady Bank^
    You are on the bank of a small tributary, just twenty yards or so in width
at this stage.  To the west is a tangled bush which you can only circumvent by

ferns and palms spread their fronds over the water.

In The Shallows^
    You are wading through tea-coloured water, your feet fortunately on firm
sand rather than thick yielding mud.  The water is cool and pleasant, and comes
as a relief in the humid heat of the jungle.  A tall tree has fallen into the
river to the west, and you prefer to ignore that direction rather than wading
in deeper to try to get around it.

Before The Quicksand^
    You almost put your foot into a patch of quicksand but notice it just in

this direction.

Fig Tree^
    You are standing at the base of a strangling fig, which started life as a
seedling growing on the trunk of another tree.  As the fig grew it came to
dominate its host, wrapping its branches around it and choking it, until the
tree within was dead and the fig strong enough to stand alone.  You can go in
any direction.

Shallow Tributary^
    You are up to your knees in the water.  From here you can go west past the

Bank Of The Tributary^
    You are wandering along the bank of a small river which flows lazily by to
the south.  A rich proliferation of trees grows here, despite the infertility
of the soil.  You find it surprising that such a diversity could arise from
what is virtually pure sand.

Sheltered Cove^
    The shore here curves inwards in a small arc, forming a bay in which the

or west along the river bank or south into the forest.

Heart Of The Rainforest^
    The forest floor here is clear, and the thin layer of leaf litter firm
under your feet.  In the subpolar forests a pine needle may take seven years to
decay; a fallen oak leaf in a temperate forest will disappear in a year or so,
yet in these humid conditions any leaf that falls will have completely rotted
away within six weeks.  As you study the leaf litter you see thousands of tiny
fungi toiling at the process of decay.

River Bank^
    You are on the bank of a small river.  To the east it curves around to the

    You are in an open part of the forest.  Far above your head the canopy
forms a roof through which only a small proportion of the sun's light
penetrates.  Much closer to the ground is the understorey, comprising short

Kapok Avenue^
    You are in a curious arrangement of trees: an avenue running from east to
west.  On either side of the avenue are tall kapok trees which reach high above
the canopy, collecting a great deal of the sun's light.  Why they have grown in
such a fashion though is a mystery.  It does not seem to be have occurred
naturally.  But if somebody planted them, then whom?  And why?

It is a relic of an ancient civilisation, though judging from the rather poor

    A more unattractive name for a location you could not imagine, yet that is

to find a way into the forest further along the bank.

Under The Trees^
    You are on the bank of the river, overshadowed by a clump of trees which
reach out over the water, dropping into it red berries from time to time, where
they are quickly snapped up by fish darting up from the bottom.  Such fish will
carry the seeds for miles up or down the river where they will deposit them to
grow at the water's edge.  Thus do these fruit trees propagate.  You try a
berry experimentally but find the taste highly unpleasant.

Could this be the secret entrance to the legendary city of El Dorado?  You can
go through the archway to the west or head out into the forest to the east.

El Dorado^
    You gasp in awe as you stand in the centre of what must once have been an
incredibly beautiful city.  While not actually made of gold, the city must
nevertheless have been extremely rich in the precious metal.  Around you the
buildings and many statues and sculptures all show signs of having once been
plated with gold leaf, and flashes of golden light from flakes on the ground
constantly catch your eye.  To the north is a massive temple, not a subtle
affair perhaps, but nevertheless a construction of great majesty.  To the west
is a proud and kingly statue standing tall in the middle of the square.  And to
the south, most magnificent of all, a palace of ancient kings towers into the
sky.

Golden Temple^
    The temple is truly beautiful inside.  Much of the splendour has of course
been looted in the past, but what remains still impresses you with its glory.
Carven godly images stand along the walls and nestle within alcoves while at
the front a sacrificial altar, though arousing your distaste, still contrives
to instil in you a grudging admiration at its design.  The only exit is to the
south.

Golden Palace^
    The roof of the palace, unfortunately, has caved in under centuries of
battling against the elements.  However, there is much here to please the eye
and you spend some time looking around the wonderful statues and wall carvings,
many of which are either of solid gold or covered with gold leaf.  This was
once an unbelievably opulent race and you wonder what can have happened to
bring it to such an end.

Golden Statue^
    This is obviously the image of one of the great kings of El Dorado.  Tall
he stands, with a cruel smile on his lips.  The elements have done little to
touch this piece, since it is made of solid gold.  Such a prize would make you
wealthy beyond your wildest dreams, if you could carry it away.  Unfortunately
you realise it must weigh several tonnes and moving it would be impossible.

River Kerapi^
    You are floating on the river Kerapi.  On either side of you are tree-lined
banks, fairly close to each other at this point.  The water is pale brown with
churned-up mud and flows swiftly downstream, carrying you with it.  There is no
way that you will be able to head upstream, so you will have to accept your
fate.

River Malazon^
    The water here is stained the colour of tea by the tannin from the leaves
falling into it from the trees above.  The water is shallow and flowing fairly
slowly so you do not immediately get washed downstream and can decide whether
you wish to clamber ashore to the north or south.

Junction Of Rivers^
    Technically speaking, this is the River Kerapi, which has just been joined
by the Malazon flowing in from the south-west.  For some time henceforward, the
water from the two rivers flows side by side, the difference in colour rather
striking.  The river is too fast-moving for you to try to head back upstream,
but you may be able to reach the northern or southern shore with some strenuous
paddling.

    You are on the River Malazon.  The water, though slow-moving, is still too
swift for you to travel against its flow.  You could perhaps gain the shore to
the south, but to the north the trees are too thick to attempt a landing there.

River Kerapi^
    You are floating down the middle of the river, following its meanders with
great ease.  With a great deal of effort you may be able to paddle back
upstream since the water is not flowing very swiftly at this point.  The river
is very wide, but you could gain the shore to north or south if you wish.

River Kerapi^
    You are gently cruising on an increasingly wide river.  You are fairly
close to the northern shore here, a bend in the river having caused you to
drift naturally closer to the shore.  You could beach here if you wish, or you
could continue to follow the river in a roughly easterly direction.

    You are in the middle of the river.  Here it is very wide indeed, perhaps
half a mile from bank to bank.  The river is flowing from north to south at
this point, having just swung around a long bend.  Further south it bends again
and resumes its eastward course.

    You find yourself caught up in a strong current which is sweeping up from
the southern polar regions.  You are powerless to prevent yourself being
carried northwards at considerable speed.  To the west the trees pass by in an
endless procession, and you begin to appreciate the vast size of it.

Carried Northward^
    You inevitably come to the end of the trees and then pass by a succession
of varied shorelines, the climate gradually becoming more and more temperate.
After what seems like an age, you begin to spot familiar landmarks.  Over to
the northwest is the volcano Mount Bandilbar, presiding over a verdant
landscape.  As you slowly draw level with it you see the mountains surrounding
the blizzard pass and, closer to you, the long stretch of shoreline to the east
of the village.  Ramshackle but comfortingly familiar, the Old Seadog looms
closer and you sigh as you finally feel you have come home at last.  The cold
southern current is now so weak as to be unnoticeable, and only your momentum
carries you the last half mile to the waters just east of the jetty.
