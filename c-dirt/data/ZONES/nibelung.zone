Castle Hohenzollern^
   As you enter this room, you can't help but notice the large coat of arms
placed in one corner of the room.  A few statues and a suit of armor are placed
around the room as a form of decoration.  The ceiling is adorned with a paint-
ing of the heavens opening, and an outpouring of cherubim and seraphim adorn
the edges.  The trim of the room is a prime example of baroque architecture.
   To the north you notice a small side yard through a doorway, while the

of different liquids, some purple, some green, and many other colors.  A wooden

Parsifal's Tower^
   This is apparently the tower of the wizard Parsifal.  As you think back, you
recall hearing of the greatness of Parsifal in a Bard's tale long ago.  Once
the Hohenzollern family was well-respected, but seemed to have run into
problems with a dragon that Parsifal had tried to tame.  Nothing had been heard
from the family since, and no one ever successfully returned from their castle.
   A small bed is in one corner of the room, and a table in the other.  The 
table is covered with old books and sheets of parchment.  A chair has been
overturned in the center of the room.

A thin layer of mud on the floor coats about an inch of your boots, and makes
walking difficult as you slide about.  The tunnel slopes down sharply, and it

like lions and tigers and bears (Oh my!), are hung periodically along the wall.
The ceiling is painted with murals depicting the hunts where the various
trophies were acquired.  To the east is the main entrance of the castle, and
to the south is a trophy room.  A large table in the room to the west brings
