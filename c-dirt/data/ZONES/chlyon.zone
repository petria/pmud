The Prison^
  You stand inside what seems to be a prison of some sorts. A huge iron gate
on the north wall bars your progress in that direction.
A plaque above the door seems to speak about a bloodthirsty monster that has
been imprisoned in this place by the ancient gods of the land. A horrible
creature, great and swift of foot and strong, whose breath was flame
unquenchable.
To the west, you can spot a legion of Thyreenean warriors practicing their
maneuvers. Maybe you shouldn't disturb them!

  You stand in a baren room, everything around you is stone and iron. Large
chains once hanged from the walls, but now they have been ripped out by

Majestic Hallway^
  You can't help but admire the beautiful craftmanship that has gone into
building this hallway. The walls are covered with an ivory-like material,
and are ornated with ancients runes and symbols whose meaning has been
lost along the years. One of them you recognize though: The symbol of
the people of Thyreen, the warriors who have pledged their lives to serving
the ancient dark gods of Chlyon, before they were overthrown. According to
the legend, the current gods of the land were impressed with the courage
the Thyreeneans displayed in battle and spared their lives with the condition
that they will dedicate their lives to making sure the legendary beast
Chimera will never again be unleashed on the lands of Chlyon.
To the south, the hallway leads off into what seems to be a throne room.

  Even more beautiful than the hallway, this room is lavishly decorated

		  "One god alone of all we loved.

  The mythical Thyreenean forge stands before you. According to legend,
it was created by the old god of fire for the Thyreenean craftsmen to
create weapons for the gods themselves. Some of those weapons have now found
their way in mortal hands. Maybe.. just maybe.. if the legends are true..
you could forge your own great weapon!
