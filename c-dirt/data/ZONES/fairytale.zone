a huge vine, rising up into the clouds. It looks strong enough to hold you.

  You stand inside a small room, decorated with pictures of great

one is open to the centerfold.
The room looks like a basic bachelor's pad.

ground.

  The seats of this ride are red vinyl, and the floors are sticky. You
sit down and rest for a moment, as the car begins to move. Soon you

Pit^
  You have fallen into a pit which rises as far up as the eye can see.
In the center of the pit is a small disc. As you approach it for a

she catches sight of you. 'Oh dear,' she exclaims, 'It's already
inhabited!'
With that, she jumps back into the disc, which closes and rises from
the ground. A violet beam of light erupts from it and spears you
between the eyes...

Furnace Room^
  You are in a large room, dominated by a huge furnace. The furnace
has a large steel grate mounted on it, through which you can see
flaming coals. A small pile of coal lies here, next to a shovel. A
tube extends from the roof of the furnace to the ceiling of the room.
To the south is the coal room, and to the west you can hear a
gurgling noise, as though water were running there.

Sewer Intake^
  The first thing you notice about this room is the large pipe which
sticks out of the ceiling. From it, a trickle of water runs down into
a large cavity in the floor. From below, you hear the sound of
rushing water, as if from an underground river. It would appear that
you have discovered an early form of sewer system.
