Inside the Grand Oak^
   You appear to be in the Old Oak, except that something's different. 
Everything seems to be fresher, newer, and more full of life. The Oak itself 
seems to be smaller, possibly because you've come to a time when it
was several centuries younger. There is passage west to the outside.

Entrance to the Elven Forest^
   A magnificent expanse of forest spreads before you. The morning mist has not
quite lifted totally from the ground, making the Elven Forest a mystical place
to gaze upon. You feel awed. The ancient forest lies in grand splendor, as yet  
untouched by the two evils warring in your present time. Instead of corruptness,
you are moved by the beauty the forest and wish that the trees would be this
lush in your own time. You have no desire to leave this beautiful land. To the 
north you see an high overview of the forest, to the south you see the entrance
of a dwelling of some sort, hidden well behind thick bushes. 
^

dwelling n:entrance e:study s:lab;
lflags {soundproof}
Nature's Dwelling^
   You have entered the dwelling of Mother Nature. Of course she lives in these
beautiful lands after creating them. Plants and animals abound within this 
place, and you feel comfortable and warm. The whirr of insects relaxes you and
you wonder what sort of person the Green Mother really is. Couches and chairs
are made out of the natural things, grown out of either wood, moss, or some
such living material.
   A miniature sun warms the place, keeping it light. The walls allow fresh air
through to circulate, and little trickles of water flow from the ceiling keeping
everything alive. The floor is springy with plantlife, and you slightly bounce
along as you walk. Two rooms are formed off of this one.
^

lab n:dwelling;
lflags {soundproof cantsummon nosummon}
Gaea's Laboratory^
   Here is where Mother Nature does her nature work. A class 'A' geneticist, 
she finds ways to alter the paths of DNA. Several large lab desks with large
countertops fill the middle of the room, and shelves with beakers and flasks
filled with chemicals line the walls. Many odd things are in this room that you 
don't dare touch, not knowing what next shall happen to you. Among these hum a
few HOOD machines, automatically sorting base-pairs from DNA strands.
^

study w:dwelling;
lflags {soundproof cantsummon nosummon}
Study^
   Books upon hundreds fill this study. An immense library is secluded in this
small dwelling, vast stores of knowledge lie here. Any book on any subject or
author is here somewhere, waiting for the reader to pick them up lovingly.
A desk with a highly advanced computer is cluttered by numerous tomes. Bright
light filters in through the window, making this a nice place to be.

Over View^
   You reach a high point in the forest, overlooking the entire forest. The mist
slightly curls upwards to the sun, dew sparkling on the ground and leaves. To
the north you see a well-worn path. East is a thick crop of shrubs. South you
see the meadow of the beginning of the Elven Forest, while westwards lies a
dense garden. The beauty might make your eyes tear a bit.

lflags {soundproof outdoors cantsummon nosummon}
Recluse^
   Forging your way through the thick shrubs, you stumble upon a hidden pond.
Clear and pure, this water allows you to see to the deepest bottom. Multi-
colored fishes swim here, cattails rustle slightly in the breeze. Water fowl
float around on it's surface. As you look about, you hear myriads of little
voices calling and taunting you. Something seems to be flitting around the 
northern end of the pond.

Fates Cavern^
   This is the Cavern of the Three Fates. In one area you see a place for
sleep, another a place to cook. In the center, a large fire burns brightly.
In one corner, there is a spinning wheel. In another, a large tapestry is
being woven on a loom. The place is quite cozy, and you get a sense of great
power from being here.
^

grove_path n:glen s:over_view;

lflags {soundproof outdoors cantsummon nosummon}
Grove Path^
   You are on a well-made path through the elven forest's beautiful canopy.
Twisting around the trees, the path takes you deep into the forest, making you
wonder where you are.
^

glen s:grove_path e:cottage;

lflags {soundproof outdoors cantsummon nosummon}
Glen^
   A small glen opens up before you, several marble benches circle a large 
fountain in the center of the area. The fountain bubbles water and glistens
brightly in the warming sun. Carved into the fountain is a sculpture of an
elven woman playing the lute, perhaps a memorial to some great lady. You see
a hidden cottage through some bushes, amongst some trees.
^

cottage w:glen;
lflags {soundproof cantsummon nosummon}
Dinthiar's Cottage^
   You have entered the home of Dinthiar, the Elven King. It is a rather simple
dwelling. A bed, table and chair are the only furnishings. However, the whole
room is given a 'foresty' feel by the way the ivy which grows up the insides
of the walls, and by the potted plants which hang from the ceiling. It is 
exactly the type of dwelling that you would expect an elf to have. A large
elvensword lies on the table, layed there by loving hands.
^

fig_garden e:over_view s:flower_garden;

lflags {soundproof outdoors cantsummon nosummon}
Fig Tree Garden^
   You arrive at a garden full of fig trees. Some fruit ripens on the branches,
swaying gently in the sun. Trees are everywhere, creating a nice grove that 
makes you feel comfortable walking around in.
   You have this weird feeling you read about this place in some sort of book
involving two people and a snake of some sort.
^

lflags {soundproof outdoors cantsummon nosummon}
Flower Garden^
   The flowers that abound here in color lie all about you. In the trees, 
on the ground, in many forms and colors. The breeze blows some of the scent
toward you, and you become heady at the fragrance.
^

gate n:flower_garden s:dark_hole;
Altitude = 800
lflags {soundproof outdoors cantsummon nosummon}
Gateway^
   A large dingy gate lies before you, half-way open, partially hidden in the
dense foliage. Even in this beautiful land, you get an odd sense of forboding
when you look at the gate. There is a sign:

                       +-----------------------------+
                       |  NO MORTALS ALLOWED ACCESS  | 
                       +-----------------------------+ 
^

dark_hole n:flower_garden;

lflags {soundproof outdoors cantsummon nosummon}
Dark Hole Behind the Gate^
   You've entered a somewhat dark, dank hole behind the dingy gate. The gate
creaks a bit, making squeals that set your hair on end. For some reason, you
don't know why, this place is off limits to normal people. There must be 
something very special here. 
^

ferns e:flower_garden s:out_back;
Altitude = 800
lflags {soundproof outdoors cantsummon nosummon}
Ferns^
   This place is overloaded with ferns. You wade through the fronds, feeling
lost in the overgrowth. Nice place to get lost.
^

out_back n:ferns;
Altitude = 800
lflags {soundproof outdoors cantsummon nosummon}
Out Back in the Bushes^
   You get a nice view of bushes. To the west you see a wall of rocks. Nothing
too special about this area, except that seeing all these nice bushes gives you
the urge Mother Nature usually provides.
