the area further inland, but you can see a gap in them where the stream's 
erosion has broken through.  The beach stretches on to your north and south, 
and the choppy sea stretches to the western horizon.

        The beach ends abruptly here, cut off by high cliffs on two sides, 
and the sea to the west.  It is impossible to see what might be atop the tall 
cliff faces,  but carved paths snake to the north and east, making it possible
to travel there yourself.  The beach stretches on to the south, where a ship 
floats in the harbor.

Beach- Southern Edge^

        The cliffs that divide this beach from the main expanse of the island 
wrap around to cut the shoreline short.  A nearly vertical wall, stretching 
out into the water and continuing south, blocks any travel in that direction.  
Steps have been cut into the face to the east, however, and should make ascent
easy.  Down the beach, to the west, stands the sea, and a ship rests in harbor
to the northwest.  The beach continues to the north.

Freshwater Outlet^

        The beach is broken here by the outpouring waters of a freshwater 
stream, forcing its way down to the ocean.  Standing on the rocks at its edge,
you can see a gap in the cliff wall, undoubtedly cut by the stream in its 
youth.  This leads to an eastern valley between the cliffs, while the beach 
reaches underneath this facade to the north and south.  To the west, the 
outlet has formed a small harbor, where a ship bobs in the choppy waves.

River Valley^

        The stream here must once have been a powerful river, because the 
valley it cut is as wide as a small glacial rift.  Trees and small shrubs 
reach up the walls of the gap, and the stream flows by to the west, where it
will rejoin the sea.  To the east, human figures move back and forth from a 
wide, shallow bank of the stream, to a forested area further to the southeast.

Rice Paddy^

        Peasants comb the rice plants growing in the shallows here, gathering 
the grain and carrying the sacks back up to their village to the southeast.  
The peasants glance at you, but hurry away without asking questions, either 
too busy or too afraid to find out who you are.  The stream flows from a slope
to the north, curves here and continues down to a broad valley to the west, 
and presumably from there out to the sea.

Peasant Village - Western Edge^

        The western entrance to the village is nothing more than a couple of
large buildings for storing rice and fish from the nearby stream.  Further to 
the east are the small wooden huts that house the inhabitants, who seem intent
on avoiding you.  Many of them disappear down the hill to the west, heading 
toward the rice paddy.  One of the storehouses is open and unguarded to the
south.

        The cliff face is worn away here, leaving an overhung, pocketed ledge 
large enough for two humans to stand under.  The floor is strewn with small 
stones, but swept in places as if someone's feet had been placed there and 
moved in small circles.  The ledge continues up and to the east, meeting up 
with a path from the beach to the cliffs.  The only other way off this ledge

stream has cut through the stone, forming a wide valley.  A narrowing rise 
leads towards the east, deeper into the cliffs and further up.  Travelling

south until it fuses into a glassy surface.  The river that flows by is a 
yellowish hue, and bubbles where it comes in contact with the shore... 
probably acid.

Cursed Lands^

        The ground is hard and glassy underfoot, and it is difficult to stand.
The mists that cover the northern forest are unrestrained here, and seep down 
around your ankles, rising occasionally in choking plumes.  To the west, a 
greyish building fights to stay above this flood, but its paper-thin walls 
have already been breached.  The northern edge of this area is the shore of a
foul yellowish river, and to the south, a wall of solid black stone rises to 
block the horizon.

Cursed Lands^

        Sheer walls of shining black stone, like obsidian mirrors, jut from 
the ground, forming a slick, sharp barrier.  You can travel no further south.

Passage through Darkness^

        The mists themselves rise to block your path as you cross this way.  
A squat grey building with torn paper walls is the only sign of life in this
desolation; it stands directly to your west.  To the east, the plain stretches
unbroken to a shore lined with black sand.

Unhallowed Halls^

        The everpresent gas seeps into this hallway through rips and tears in 
the paper walls.  Sliding doors in all major directions do little to hide the
contents of this building's other rooms.  From the general layout, this would
be a dojo, a training hall.  To the north are the sleeping quarters, to the 
south, a training facility, an armory of sorts lies to the west, and the 
eastern portal is open to the "air."  A rickety ladder also leads upward onto
wooden platforms above.

Sleeping Hall^

        The northern hall of this dojo has been filled with straw pallets, 
and converted into sleeping quarters.  Students had no need for worldly 
posessions or comfort, and so their bedding was the necessary minimum.  
Black tar oozes from the splintered floor, soaking into the matresses.

Training Hall^

        Training took many forms for the students of this dojo, as the varied
equipment here shows.  Wooden targets, some broken, some bloodied, stand to
either side of a straw ring, which is similarly stained and damaged.  A few 
straw dummies dressed in clothing and armor were used to begin weapons 
training. Of course, there was no substitute for human instruction, and 
several marked areas on the floor undoubtedly served as sparring rings.

Weapons Hall^

        Empty hooks, pegs, and rings wait for weapons that will never be hung
here again.  Wooden forms for armor stand like bare skeletons. This room once 
held enough weaponry for a small army, but now only a few pieces remain.  
Either scavengers or the retreating students have taken everything of value.

A thin wooden ladder is the only way down short of jumping.

Dojo- Upper Room^

        This section of the upper level is open on two sides- to the south to
allow passage back and forth between the two platforms, and to the north, only
a small window-slit is left open.  A post outside offers some clue as to the 
purpose: small indentations in the wood indicate some sort of impact.  A 
practice course for some skill, perhaps.

Road of the Cherry Blossoms^

        This road is bound on either side by lines of cherry trees, all in 
full bloom and drifting their petals down onto the road surface.  You can see 
the spires of Eno far to the north, and to the south are more cherry trees, 
which seem to be planted in an obscuring pattern.

Cherry Orchard- Western Entrance^

        The road here passes from the open countryside to the west to a 
tangled "orchard" of cherry trees to the east.  The road passes directly under 
the boughs, and is covered with falling petals.  A small path leads north from 
this spot, toward another grove of blossoming trees, possibly apple or pear.
These orchards are the pride of Eno, and stretch on for many miles.

Cherry Orchard- Southern Entrance^

        A line of blossoming cherry trees abruptly divides the barren country-
side from a tangled "orchard", stretching back beyond sight.  The trees are so
tightly packed that only the road offers a way through to the north. The 
southern end of the road disappears into the scrub and stone of a blasted
plain.

        This clear spot is almost totally surrounded by apple trees, which 
drop pink and white petals around you as the wind picks up.  A narrow path 
leads back to the south, where a wider road crosses it.  The branches rustle 
occasionally, and you shiver.

Road to Eno^

        The road stretches across the plain, from a cherry orchard far to the 
south to the vast city of Eno to the north.  The city is plainly visible, a 
dark mass of spires and rooftops stacked one on another, surrounded by a 
palisaded earthen wall.  Only the front edge of the orchard can be seen, with
the road passing into a gap therein.  The countryside is burnt and blasted, 
and a black streak crosses the road in front of you.

Gates of Eno^

        The City of Eno rises high above you to the immediate north.  However,
 a massive gate stands between there and here, and a padlock of proportionate 
size is on its door.  High earthen walls wrap around to the east and west, and
their smooth sides would make climbing impossible without help.  
A road leading from the gates reaches off toward the south, to a grove of 
trees far in the distance, and a narrow dirt path leads off to the east.

Ruined Shrine^

        This was once a Shinto shrine outside Eno. Now, it is a pile of rubble
beneath two cracked pillars.  The main platform is largely intact beneath the
rocks, but its surface has been scorched and scraped by something.  Trees that
once made this an oasis of nature near the city's walls have been torn down, 
giving you a clear view of those ramparts and the spires beyond.

Eno Courtyard^

        Just behind the walls of Eno is the only clear spot in the city: 
A large courtyard flanked by statues and landscaping.  Koi float belly-up in
small pools, and once-beautiful stone gardens have been raked across by claws
rather than garden tools.  A stench of sulfur hangs in the air, which seems to
darken as you near the center of the city, the daimyo's fortress to the north.
To the west, a guardhouse has been erected along the wall.   To the east, the 
remains of the city's homes lie in long-dead ashes.
        The city walls are in the opposite direction- south- and the barred 
gate looks impassable from this side.  The high earthen walls are too smooth 
to climb without aid.

        There's not much to see or do here, the wooden buildings have burned 
totally to the ground and the stone structures have been torn apart.  Here and
there, you can see lighter patches which often turn out to be bones or broken 
marble statues, but mostly the landscape is an even, sooty black.  The roads 
are all clogged except for the path back to the west.

        The only standing building higher than two stories, other than the 
fortress itself, is this guard tower, set against the defensive wall.  This
lower floor held rows of bunks, which are now overturned and torn, as well as
the armor and personal effects of the city's defenders.  A plank staircase 
leads up to the open platform above.

Guard House Tower^

        The top floor of the guard house overlooks the countryside around 
Eno.. a view one could easily do without.  To match the destruction within the
city walls, sections of the land are also burned away, in strips that match 
the path of a landing meteorite.  Bubbling pools of various colors have 
erupted from the ground where these streaks end, and seem to spread across 
the land as you watch.  The cherry orchard to the south smokes where Kashai 
fell.  The only safe way out of here is down...

        No battle plans are drawn up in the War Room, no maps with clay or

Go board, standing in a quiet corner.

discarded sacks, husks, and other trash stands in the midst of the

enough to breach that security and occupy the fortress itself.   A staircase 
leads back down to the fortress' lower floors, and three pairs of double 
doors stand to the north, east, and south.

The Heavens^

        The vast, otherworldly aspect of this room takes some time to 
assimilate:  The domed ceiling looks up into the sky, but the view is 
unencumbered by clouds, haze, or indeed, air.  Bare suns and glowing nebulae
illuminate the space in which you stand.  Dragons wheel about these heavens 
occasionally, glancing down on you in amusement.  And before you... before you
is the Orb of Yin and Yang, capable of throwing the balance of creation to 
good or evil exclusively.  The Demon could not harness its full power, so 
undoubtedly you cannot either, but even at its weakest the Orb could make you
a formidable ruler... but it must be returned to its place.  The steel arch 
that transported you in waits to the north, and a strange circular portal 
hovers to the south, visible but not solid.
