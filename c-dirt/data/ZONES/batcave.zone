Bottom of the stairs.^
Flashing lights come from the room to the west, and a strange flapping sound
comes from the east.

Bat Cave^
You have entered a large cave.  High above you, through the dim light you
make out what appears to be hundreds of small stalactites hanging from the
ceiling.  There is a strong musty smell in the air which is almost
overpowering.  Belatedly you realize the smell comes from the animal droppings
which cover the floor, and that what you thought were stalactites are actually
hundreds of vampire bats.

Dark Hall^
This hall is dark and musty.  The walls are made of solid soil and the floor
is muddy and silppery.  A small light appears in the room south of you and
curious flapping sounds can be heard from the west.

Tomb of the Unknown Samurai^
This room stands as a shrine to the mightiest samurai warrior of them all,
Toshiro Mafune.  The walls are covered with Japanese water color paintings
of fantastic battles and proud Shogun rulers.

Laboratory^
You are standing in an old laboratory that seems to have been abandoned long
ago.  Discarded glassware on high shelves is filled with dust, the long
since rotted-out remains of spell components and magical substances.  Off to
the west you hear a low moaning sound, but all you hear is quiet to the
east.

You notice the room spinning about you.  Ultimately you realize it is not the
room, but your head which is rolling across the blood stained floor as your
body collapses to the ground.
